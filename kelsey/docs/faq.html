      <p>
        <span class="q">Q: What's new in version 3?</span>
        <span class="a">
          A: The previously separate SoA and ToB parts of Kelsey have
          been combined into a single package. Version 3 is also
          compatible with BGII: EE, includes a Russian translation and
          some modernizations for easier installation and improved
          mod compatibility.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">Q: What's new in version 2?</span>
        <span class="a">
          A: There are well over 200 new lines of dialogue. Kelsey has
          new interactions with "scenery" characters like Ribald
          Barterman. Kelsey has more to say about the city of
          Athkatla, including in a new banter with Valygar. The
          "final" conflict between Anomen and Kelsey for the PC's
          affections has been pushed out much later, and three new
          romance conflict sessions have been added. Several existing
          romance conversations have been improved with new player
          dialogue options. The sequences with Merritt/Lilla and Ceara
          have been tweaked.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Why is Kelsey complaining about me stealing from
          shopkeepers?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Because he's a merchant and doesn't approve of that sort
          of thing. In terms of game mechanics he's actually
          complaining about you getting caught. Get caught too often,
          and Kelsey has words.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: How do I upgrade from an earlier version?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: When we started Kelsey we worked on a patch system, but
          in the long run it's become clear that even with the
          additional inconvenience of re-downloading audio, it's in
          everyone's best interest in terms of stability and ease of
          use to stick with one unified download. As of V3, the SOA
          and TOB content are contained in the same package.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Kelsey looks like an elf! Is this a bug?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: No, this is "making the best of a bad situation." The
          human male mage avatar has a long beard. Kelsey does not, so
          the best answer was to give him the elven male mage
          avatar. Try not to let the ears bother you too much. As an
          alternative you can install the modified paperdoll from
          <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/kelsey">http://www.pocketplane.net/kelsey</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Is Kelsey compatible with Ascension?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes, Kelsey and the optional Ascension content module
          were designed for compatibility with WeiDU Ascension. We
          recommend V 1.4.12 or greater.  Although Kelsey will work
          atop an Ascension Classic install, his Ascension content
          module is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ASCENSION CLASSIC.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Kelsey's name is all screwed up! He's saying Saladrex
          lines when I click on him! Various other weird things are
          happening!  Why?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: His CRE strings are messed up. Don't worry about the
          technical explanation. Use the talk fixer to correct
          it. Click on Kelsey and press the K key. Not CTRL+K, not
          SHIFT+K, not ALT+K, just regular K.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Does Kelsey have interjections in TOB?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Oh, yes, including in Watcher's Keep (although like the
          Biowareans, they only work in TOB chapters... if there's a
          lot of demand and a lot of free time, we can make them SOA
          compliant.) Quite a few, we think you'll be pleased.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Can Kelsey's cloak be upgraded?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes, Cespenar can do it. Have Kelsey talk to him a couple
          of times (not the PC.) You'll get better bonuses and a 1x
          per day Spell Sequencer out of it (so hopefully you didn't
          take that spell already!)
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Is Kelsey Macintosh compatible?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes, and should install on Linux/Wine environments as
          well.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: I found a bug! What should I do?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Firstly, are you running the absolute latest patch for
          SOA or TOB, as obtained
          from <a href="www.bioware.com">www.bioware.com</a>? Did you
          install it before you installed Kelsey and all other mods?
          If not, we can't be held responsible.<br /><br />

          Then, check the Kelsey forum at
          <a href="http://forums.pocketplane.net">http://forums.pocketplane.net</a>
          to see if it has been addressed, or to see if a newer
          version of Kelsey is available. Post about your bug on the
          forum if you cannot find an answer.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Anomen/Jaheira/Aerie/Viconia are acting funny. Their love
          theme is playing, but they're not speaking romance
          dialogue. What's wrong?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Dollars to donuts, you have a version of Solaufein
          PRE-V40 installed. You will need to uninstall that version
          of Solaufein (and restore it with a newer one if you so
          choose) to correct this problem. This problem is not
          actually caused by Kelsey, but because of his bickering with
          Anomen, it is easier to see.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: What other mods is Kelsey compatible with?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: All of them, basically.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: How do I uninstall Kelsey (V1.0.1 or greater)?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Run Setup-Kelsey.exe in your main BG2 directory and
          select the U option for Uninstall.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Who should I have in my party with Kelsey?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: That is entirely up to you. Including the romance
          conflicts with Anomen, Kelsey has at least one interaction
          with all of the available NPCs in BG2, so you&#8217;re going
          to see some new dialogue no matter what you do. He has more
          banter with some characters than with others.  Jan leads the
          pack, while some NPCs such as Cernd and Haer&#8217;Dalis
          have fewer conversations with Kelsey.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Are there any things I can only see if I romance Kelsey?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes, the obvious things: the actual Kelsey romance thread
          (more than two dozen sessions long), special Kelsey dialogue
          at the Tree of Life, and the romance conflict with Anomen.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Are there any things I can only see if I DON&#8217;T
          romance Kelsey?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes. If you choose not to romance Kelsey (or have a
          male/incompatible female PC), Kelsey will initiate a couple
          of other conversations with the PC. Kelsey will also try to
          "pick up" Nalia if the PC is not romancing him. In
          Kelsey-TOB, Kelsey and Imoen can have a romance.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Is there anything you want to tell me about how to pick
          spells for Kelsey?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Truly, you should try to find your own way with the later
          spell picks, or rely on the (sometimes disagreeing)
          unofficial sorcerer FAQs out there at sites such as
          <a href="www.gamefaqs.com">www.gamefaqs.com</a>. We will say
          this: You will likely find it a waste to give Kelsey the
          fourth-level spell Minor Sequencer. A Kelsey quest item will
          remove the need to spend a precious spell slot on that
          particular incantation.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Is Kelsey a better mage than Edwin, Jan, Nalia, or Imoen?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Kelsey is a sorcerer, so he is a DIFFERENT mage from all
          of the above. You&#8217;ll have to make that determination
          for yourself.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Does Bodhi abduct Kelsey in Chapter 6 like she does
          Jaheira, Aerie, Viconia, and Anomen?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes. That section should appear quite familiar to
          experienced players.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Will Anomen and Kelsey fight over my female PC, like
          Aerie, Jaheira, and Viconia fight over my male PC?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: In all likelihood, yes. Kelsey and Anomen both like more
          or less the same kinds of women. As long as Anomen is in the
          party relatively early in the Kelsey romance, you should see
          the sparks fly. If you add one significantly later than the
          other, however, you may not see everything.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: What happens when I reach the Throne of Bhaal portion of the game?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Kelsey will continue on like any other NPC. If you didn't
          have Kelsey in your party when you make the transition
          between SOA and TOB, you can summon Kelsey from the Fate
          Spirit like any other NPC.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: What is this special ability Kelsey suddenly has?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: It's the side-effect of Jan's experiment gone
          wrong. Kelsey can polymorph someone into a bowl of oatmeal
          once per day. The effect is rather like a Finger of Death,
          with a save -2 vs. polymorph. (no effect if save made.) The
          JAGMIFR Mark IV was not a total failure after all.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Okay, but WHY?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Because the Jansen Sorcerer Visual Enhancement Sphere
          (JSVES) was probably the single most popular component of
          Kelsey-SOA and we wanted an encore.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: What's the Kelsey-TOB romance like?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: There are a dozen interactions on the "sequence", plus
          "floating lovetalks" that can appear at any time
          in-game. Like the Bioware NPCs, a few of them are
          event-driven (the defeat of the Master Wraith, the fall of
          Saradush, the end of the Pocket Plane trials) but most are
          not.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Kelsey wants to stay behind in Saradush. Will he come
          back?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes, he'll meet you in Amkethran in a few days.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Do we find out anything more about Kelsey's family
          problems?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Yes. We'll meet his brother and his uncle. Kelsey has a
          lot more to say about his mother in V2. And the epilogues
          address what happens to them as well.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: How do I see the Imoen romance? What's in it?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: All it requires is that the PC NOT be in a romance with
          Kelsey, and of course take Imoen in your party with
          him. Note that disbanding one or both of them does not
          terminate the romance. Note also that if one or the other
          spends a lot of time invisible with the Staff of the Magi,
          it might make seeing the LTs a little tricky, so if it seems
          like you're not seeing their discussions, try making them
          both visible and standing them near one another.<br /><br />

          There are several sequenced LOVETALKs, plus some "floating"
          LOVETALKs that can take place any time after Imoen's
          developed her STR/DEX bonus Bhaal ability.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: How do I STOP the Imoen romance, or at least threaten
          Kelsey's life?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: There is an opportunity to forbid Kelsey to speak to
          Imoen, and another spot to warn him about consequences. But
          don't expect 100% victory.  In love, you are not the boss of
          Kelsey.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: What about the other projects about romancing or
          "relationshipping" Imoen? How will Kelsey react?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Kelsey beat them all to market. Nyah. Unlike introducing
          new mod NPCs to fight for the protagonist's affections,
          having mod NPCs romance another NPC is a little different,
          since there's only one way to roleplay it, yet multiple
          writers with (obviously) very different visions are trying
          to tell their story.<br /><br />

          Bottom line: See their READMEs. We make no provision for
          them.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: I am uncomfortable with/offended by/encountering bugs
          with this "flirting" stuff. How do I get rid of it?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: If you don't want to start flirts with Kelsey, don't
          click to talk to him. If you want him to stop flirting with
          you, click to talk to him and tell him so. He will stop
          forever.<br /><br />

          However, this may not be enough if you encounter a bug,
          which COULD happen if another mod were introduced and
          affected Kelsey's J#KLS25J dialogue file. (The most likely
          bug is that you would see the flirt- with-Kelsey screen when
          you expected something else. Developers please note that
          this can be avoided by simply ensuring that your new
          J#KLS25J state gets weighted higher than the flirt pack
          top-levels, which should always be the bottom of the stack.)<br /><br />

          If this happens, you will need to use a little basic
          cheating/hacking to set the global variable FWDisableFlirts
          to 1. You can do this in a saved game with Shadow Keeper or
          Near Infinity, or if you use the cheat console:
          CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("FWDisableFlirts","GLOBAL",1)<br /><br />

          Note that you can re-enable flirting by setting that value
          back to 0.<br /><br />

        <span class="q">
          Q: I told Kelsey I was going to have a baby. Are we going to
          actually have it in the game, like Aerie?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: No. The PC won't even begin to show. We could have
          implemented the whole bit--encumbrance penalty, lower DEX,
          fatigue, etc... but it just didn't seem worth it. So please
          don't rest for 500 days waiting for the baby to come. It
          won't happen. The baby can play a major role in the
          epilogues, however.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: I don't want my PC to be pregnant!
        </span>

          A: Then simply don't TELL him that you're pregnant. Unlike
          real life, if you don't say it, it won't be true.<br /><br />

          This dialogue is part of LOVETALK 22 (informally known as
          the "confessional LOVETALK") but all of the conversations in
          that session are completely optional. If you don't want to
          be pregnant, don't say you are to Kelsey, and it will be
          not-true. Simple.

          If your PC DID become pregnant but is having second
          thoughts, there will be an opportunity to change her mind.

          Q: How many epilogues does Kelsey have?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: There are ten total Kelsey epilogues (one for no
          romances, one for Imoen, five for PC-stays, three for
          PC-ascends), plus a new Imoen epilogue if she ends up in a
          romance with Kelsey. There are two major themes to the
          PC-stays epilogues, although they have different details
          depending on the choices you make. The others, including the
          three PC-ascends epilogues, are all rather different.

          Q: What impacts Kelsey's epilogues? How can I see them all?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: The biggest impacts come from whether or not he is in a
          romance with Imoen, the PC, or nobody. If romancing the PC,
          whether or not she chooses to stay looms large. If the PC is
          pregnant and Ascends, the decision of whether to actually
          have the child, and whether to keep it on the Planes or
          return it to Kelsey has a rather significant impact on
          Kelsey's life.  Whether or not you agreed to marry Kelsey
          and/or have a child with him impacts the "staying with
          Kelsey" romance epilogues as well. And reminding Kelsey that
          you want him to have his "rickety mage's tower" has a huge
          impact, if indeed your PC stays with him to build it.

          Q: What's this about cheating on Kelsey?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: If Anomen is in your party, after you finish off Gromnir,
          Anomen will make tentative advances on the PC. It happens
          during two conversations upon rest. The first is innocent,
          but in the second, he implies that there is a spark between
          you. It's up to you whether you take him up on his
          offer. Note that the "less good" he is, the easier it is to
          get him in bed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="q">
          Q: Hey, wait a sec! I cheated with Anomen, lost Kelsey from
          the party, and now Anomen doesn't want to get serious with
          me! What gives?
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Them's the breaks. I considered turning on the Anomen
          romance in that event but it didn't make any sense: the
          Anomen TOB romance is based on the shared, life-altering
          experiences of SOA, not a faithless fling. So it would not
          have been "right." And this is a Kelsey MOD first and
          foremost, so writing an entirely new romance track for
          Anomen just wasn't in the cards.<br /><br />

          And besides, you should roast in Demogorgon's belly for
          wronging Kelsey so grievously anyway.

          instead? THAT would have been fun!
        </span>
        <span class="a">
          A: Believe it or not, a significant portion of the remaining
          BG2 player base LIKES Anomen and the Anomen romance, so it
          seemed the most natural choice. We already know that Anomen
          under normal circumstances was/is attracted to the PC.
