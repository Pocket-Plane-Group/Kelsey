@1   = ~So... I gather that your trip to Amn was not exactly by choice. Have you ever been in these lands before?~ [FWKLSY52]
@2   = ~No, and I certainly would rather that the choice had been left up to me.~
@3   = ~I saw little but Candlekeep until I came of age, and even then I've mostly just seen some of the choicer destinations along the Sword Coast.~
@4   = ~I don't have time to discuss my travel itinerary with you.~
@5   = ~I can certainly understand that. Being somewhere you never intended to go, even a pleasant place, can be annoying enough. And I take it Irenicus was not exactly running a sweet shop.~
@6   = ~For my money, Amn isn't the friendliest of lands even if you don't happen to be a spellcaster, but the climate is pleasant enough and the commerce of Athkatla and Trademeet keep bringing me back.~
@7   = ~Unfortunately, I travel so much that a lot of the places I've been seem to blend in my mind, one into the other. I'm really not sure how much use I'll be to you as a local guide.~
@8   = ~That's all right. I am never afraid to stop and ask directions.~
@9   = ~I'm not here to buy land and settle down, I'm on a mission. The finer details will resolve themselves.~
@10  = ~For my purposes, a skilled mage will serve far better than a walking map.~
@11  = ~You're barely making the grade in any respect. Make yourself useful and be quiet.~
@12  = ~Oh, I get it, because the men in the party will be too proud to humble themselves for a map? Cute.~
@13  = ~I admire your dedication. Still, I hope you can take some time out to tell me more of Candlekeep some day.~
@14  = ~Ah. Well, if I see one, I'll point him out to you. In the meantime, I'll fill in.~
@15  = ~Kidding.~
@16  = ~Really? I almost wish I could have had such a cloistered upbringing. I spent half of my childhood travelling with my father, and recently I've done little but go from waypoint to waypoint.~
@17  = ~Sorry for the intrusion, then.~
@18  = ~I know your arrival in Athkatla was inconvenient and upsetting, but I have to admit that I'm glad it gave me the opportunity to meet a new friend.~ [FWKLSY53]
@19  = ~Since this madness started, two of my companions have lost their lives and a third is being detained with a psychopath. I would call that more than an "inconvenience," Kelsey.~
@20  = ~It's not quite as simple as you make it sound, Kelsey.~
@21  = ~Yes, well, the trip has not been without its rewards so far.~
@22  = ~I have way too much on my mind to talk to you now.~
@23  = ~I hope you're referring to somebody else. You're a tool, not a friend, sorcerer.~
@24  = ~I'm so sorry, I knew about Imoen but I hadn't heard of any other companions who didn't make it out. Anything you want to talk about?~
@25  = ~Dynaheir and Khalid, trusted companions and valued friends, both died before I could reach them.~
@26  = ~Dynaheir and Khalid were weak, so they succumbed to Irenicus and his minions.~
@27  = ~Not really.~
@28  = ~Dynaheir and Khalid, trusted companions and valued friends, both died before I could reach them.~
@29  = ~Dynaheir and Khalid, trusted companions and valued friends, both died before I could reach them.~
@30  = ~Dynaheir and Khalid were weak, so they succumbed to Irenicus and his minions.~
@31  = ~Dynaheir and Khalid were weak, so they succumbed to Irenicus and his minions.~
@32  = ~All right. I would like to help, though, and if it would help you to talk about it, I'm here. That's what friends do for each other, I seem to recall.~
@33  = ~I'm so sorry. I have certainly seen my share of fallen companions, but I suppose I am fortunate not to have been close to many of them. I imagine it's only more difficult for a leader, such as yourself.~
@34  = ~You truly have had a rough time of it lately, so I apologize if I came off as flippant. Although I, personally, would not trade for having met you, I would not be offended if you did not feel the same way.~
@35  = ~I cannot bring back the dead, and the lost can always be found, so I am glad to make the most of it in your presence.~
@36  = ~Yes, well, no offense but I would rather we had met another time, another place.~
@37  = ~This is a pointless thought exercise.~
@39  = ~No, and I certainly would rather that the choice had been left up to me.~
@41  = ~No, and I certainly would rather that the choice had been left up to me.~
@42  = ~Of course, I didn't mean to sound callous about your friend Imoen.~
@43  = ~It's not just Imoen. Two other companions lost their lives as well.~
@44  = ~Yes, well, be more careful in the future.~
@45  = ~Talking to you is taking up way too much of my valuable time.~
@46  = ~Truly, that's the nicest thing anybody's said to me all day.~
@47  = ~I'm curious about the people you've kept company with recently. Have I met everyone of importance yet?~
@48  = ~Something like that, yes. ~
@49  = ~Not exactly. My former captor did more than just imprison and injure me, he cost some their lives.~
@50  = ~Then I hope that any friend of yours will be a friend of mine, and vice versa. Or that all of your friends will be my friends. Or something like that. Never mind, I think I've just confused myself.~
@51  = ~Sorry, expert timing has never been one of my long suits.~
@52  = ~Ah. So that's how it is. Fine, I'll not make that mistake twice.~
@53  = ~I'm so sorry. I have certainly seen my share of fallen companions, but I suppose I am fortunate not to have been close to many of them. I imagine it's only more difficult for a leader, such as yourself.~
@54  = ~I am glad to hear you say that. It's not often I have a chance to meet a true friend.~
@55  = ~I more than understand. But I do hope you can grow to value my friendship, even it did not come to be under the brightest of skies.~
@56  = ~I see. Perhaps they would have fared better if you had not been parted from them, then.~
@57  = ~I guess it really is true... some people are born to lead. I'm impressed by the way you have managed this group so far.~ [FWKLSY54]
@58  = ~I've always wondered what makes good leaders. Do you think it was something you were born with, or have you had to learn?~
@59  = ~Gorion taught me much about giving and earning respect. The rest is just experience, I suppose.~
@60  = ~People do what I say because they don't want my fist to connect with their teeth.~
@61  = ~I don't think of myself as a leader, and everyone in my company is free to come and go as they please.~
@62  = ~These talks bore me, mageling. Stick to what you know and leave me in peace.~
@63  = ~Let's discuss this when I'm not so busy.~
@64  = ~Heredity and environment, eh? That makes sense.~
@65  = ~I seem to make a much better functionary than a leader. Ever since my father died and I tried to replace him as director of the trading company, it seems that I have a hard time being taken seriously as an authority figure.~
@66  = ~Yes, but you were barely old enough to grow a beard then, weren't you? Some people let appearances fool them, and I think you command respect of your own.~
@67  = ~Taking orders well is no disgrace. Leaders need followers, and vice versa.~
@68  = ~Some people have a hard time taking you seriously now, you wimp.~
@69  = ~That's kind of you to say, <CHARNAME>, although the truth is I still can't grow much of a beard.~
@70  = ~As for you... well, I know that there are still many battles left to fight, but I suppose I'm so impressed by what I've seen so far that I'm almost taking it for granted that if someone's missing, you'll find them, and if someone's hurt you, you'll double it coming back.~
@71  = ~Thank you for the vote of confidence. You do realize that flattery does not earn you an extra share of party treasure, right?~
@72  = ~I only do what I must to keep myself and my friends safe.~
@73  = ~Yes, well, just watch yourself so that I neither have to rescue or punish you, then.~
@74  = ~Ah, no, that wasn't my intention. I just wanted to let you know that I find you... impressive, and intriguing.~
@75  = ~And I'm glad for all of our sakes that you're good at what you do.~
@76  = ~<CHARNAME>, I would never dream of crossing you. I hope we can become good enough friends that you won't doubt that.~
@77  = ~I suppose, but it would be nice to have the... presence, or whatever it is, to be able to choose which to be.~
@78  = ~That was a nasty thing to say. I take it all back, everything nice I've said about you.~
@79  = ~Not everyone responds terribly well to that iron fist school of thought, but I won't deny that your bad side is a dangerous place to be. I think you're selling yourself short if you think that's the only way you can inspire people, though.~
@80  = ~Yes, but the fact that people come, stay, and listen to you should certainly count for something. I think you are selling yourself short.~
@81  = ~All right, I'll try to take orders in a manner you won't find so tedious and tiresome, then.~
@82  = ~No problem.~
@83  = ~I was talking to HER, not to you.~ [FWKLSY55]
@84  = ~Speaking of which, I would say it is well past time you admitted you have lice in your beard. Perhaps while you shave it, I can finish my thought in peace.~
@85  = ~Sir Keldorn, I hope you're not getting any funny ideas. I have no desire to hurt anyone, but I am not helpless to defend myself.~ [FWKLSYB6]
@86  = ~I know full well that you are a sworn Inquisitor, and I also know full well we are in Amn, where inquisitors and mage-hunters are given a very free hand.~
@87  = ~All I'm saying is that I don't want to be part of helping you make your monthly quota for mage scalps.~
@88  = ~I am glad to hear it, but I can't believe you attained your rank in the Order by shaking hands with local potion-brewers.~
@89  = ~What of the Cowled Wizards? They are certainly no friends of mine, but I have seen their enforcers work with brutal efficiency. Why should a paladin get involved?~
@90  = ~Yes, I see your point. The Cowled Ones are nothing if not corrupt. You've given me a lot to think on. I apologize for insulting you, Sir Keldorn.~
@91  = ~Valygar, do you have a moment to talk?~ [FWKLSY87]
@92  = ~But I'd like to talk to you about you and your family. I know that magic--~
@93  = ~Look, I really--fine, I'll talk. You listen, and chime in if I say anything interesting.~
@94  = ~I know about you and your family, how magic is so dangerously strong in your blood. In my family, though, there's hardly any magic. I have a few cousins who are minor priests, but that's about it.~
@95  = ~Then there's me, Kelsey the Sorcerer, Kelsey the Weirdo. Nobody really seems to know why I am the way I am, or what it means.~
@96  = ~I know you're afraid of magic and mages. You know what? I am too, which means I'm afraid of myself. And the more I hear about your family, the more afraid I am.~
@97  = ~I used to worry that, because I didn't have to study magic like normal wizards, that my power must come from somewhere else. I thought maybe it was my soul being eaten away, but then I thought that was a silly idea.~
@98  = ~Then I hear about your parents and Lavok, and now I'm even more worried. Every time I cast a magic missile at one of our enemies, am I becoming some sort of twisted monster inside? Am I going to wind up so power-mad some day that I'd... I'd turn on my own family? Am I...?~
@99  = ~What?~
@100 = ~I see. Well, can I ask you a favor, then? At least while we're travelling together, do you think you could... keep an eye on me? Let me know if you think my magic is really making me lose touch with reality? After all, you've probably dealt with more corrupt mages than anyone, even <CHARNAME>.~
@101 = ~Ah. Well. I'm not sure I actually feel better having talked.~
@102 = ~Minsc, I know that some wizards keep an animal familiar, but I can honestly say I've never seen a warrior with a hamster.~ [FWKLSY88]
@103 = ~You know, evil wizards have imps and good wizards might have a hawk or a cat or something like that. I think of familiars as matching their master's personality, and I can't say I know any other berserker rangers, but I would have thought that a wolf or something like that would have been more fitting.~
@104 = ~Nalia, do you mind if I take a look at your spellbook?~ [FWKLSY90]
@105 = ~That's just my point. Please, let me see it. If I steal it, you know you could just steal it back.~
@106 = ~Hmmm. Yes, as usual, it still just doesn't make sense to me. Every now and then I steal a look at somebody's spellbook, and it's always the same, it doesn't make sense.~
@107 = ~All these spells. Most just look like gibberish to me. Even the ones in here that I recognize, that I can cast myself, they don't look right in your book. They don't feel right. Kind of like if someone told you that you were eating pork but it tasted like chicken.~
@108 = ~That's what bothers me so much. I often wonder why someone with a real head for magic, like you, didn't get my powers instead of me. I feel like my potential is being wasted because I have it, rather than someone else.~
@109 = ~Thanks for making me feel a little better, Nalia.~
@110 = ~By the way, because of my, ah, special magic I sometimes have trouble casting spells from scrolls. Do you think you might give me a few pointers... over dinner, sometime?~
@111 = ~You have nice hands, Nalia. I've been watching you cast spells, and I couldn't help but notice.~ [FWKLSY91]
@112 = ~Do you use anything special on them, to keep them soft?~
@113 = ~Ah. Well, it doesn't show, they still look good.~
@114 = ~You also have very nice eyes.~
@115 = ~They are a very lovely chestnut brown. But I noticed they've been looking a little puffy lately. I know how hard it can be to get anything like good sleep on the road, so I imagine mine look even worse.~
@116 = ~I handled my family's cosmetics account at one point, so I know what to look for. Just say the word and I'm sure I can get the next apothecary we meet to whip up something that will help. My treat. I'd be glad to.~
@117 = ~Ah. I see. Is it this Isaea character, then, or do you just not want to consort with a lowly shopkeeper's son?~
@118 = ~You amaze me, Aerie.~ [FWKLSY92]
@119 = ~You amaze me. Sometimes my head is a mess trying to keep track of the spells I can cast, and there really aren't that many.~
@120 = ~But you have that thick spellbook, plus you're channeling the energy of a pair of gods. I'm getting a headache just thinking about all the possibilities, and I'm not the one who has to actually juggle it all.~
@121 = ~Don't you get tired, though? Physically tired casting all those spells, and emotionally tired worrying every night about preparing for whatever bizarre battle tomorrow morning might bring?~
@122 = ~Like I said, you amaze me.~
@123 = ~Jan, I've been warned not to ask you this, or anything for that matter, but... is there any history of sorcery in your family?~ [FWKLSY94]
@124 = ~Um, ok, but the sorcerers?~
@125 = ~Jan, I demand a refund on this conversation.~
@126 = ~Do you ever wonder what motivates great or terrible people to become what they are? Where does that ambition come from, do you think?~ [FWKLSY56]
@127 = ~Ambition comes from the left elbow, I believe.~
@128 = ~Everyone has a dream. Some people just work harder to achieve it.~
@129 = ~Strength breeds ambition. Power is wasted without vision.~
@130 = ~Ask somebody who cares.~
@131 = ~Hah! I am trying to be serious, though.~
@132 = ~I used to think that ambition was inbred, and that is why there are great dynasties and noble families and so forth. But then I realized a lot of important families breed wastrels.~
@133 = ~Not to mention the fact that storybooks and bards overflow with tales of rags to riches success, and great heroes who rose from anonymity and obscurity. So if it is not breeding, and it is not necessarily background, what is it?~
@134 = ~A great adventurer could just have easily stayed home churning butter. Some kings abdicate their thrones because the pressure is too much to bear, others think they know what they're doing and make a mess of things because they are not nearly as clever as they are ambitious.~
@135 = ~So, what is it? It's not background, it's not breeding, it's not even necessarily connected to competence. What makes people... want?~
@136 = ~We all have needs, and who we are inside determines what we do to fulfill them.~
@137 = ~Everyone needs to feel successful. Some people are born feeling that need more sharply.~
@138 = ~Ambition is what talent and skill needs to be useful. It's application. It's like the muscle behind the brainpower.~
@139 = ~I wonder, then, what that says about me? I mean, I would have been perfectly content to follow in my father's footsteps and run the trading company, if things were normal.~
@140 = ~But when I started casting... I don't know, <CHARNAME>, I feel obligated to do something more, to really make a difference.~
@141 = ~Then again, was I really born to make a difference? Is this all some big joke, giving a small army's worth of magical energy to a kid who just wanted to balance the books and keep the customer happy?~
@142 = ~Should I be living my life as I was born, or as I became? Which is right? If I were as ambitious as you, wouldn't I know the answer?~
@143 = ~Whatever feels right to you, Kelsey. I cannot tell you how to live.~
@144 = ~I have seen enough to know that your place is here, with us or with people like us. You are a sorcerer. Be one.~
@145 = ~It sounds to me like you should go back behind that counter, if you can't handle the pressure.~
@146 = ~I apologize, I was not trying to ask you to make up my mind for me.~
@147 = ~I feel... I feel that I belong here, with you, although I am still uncomfortable with the idea of destiny.~
@148 = ~Let us hope that all our decisions are our own.~
@149 = ~Sometimes I have wanted to escape that reality, to make my powers someone else's problem, but you're right, I am and I should be one.~
@150 = ~I want to stay here, for as long as possible. Thank you for making me feel welcome.~
@151 = ~I hope to learn more about your own ambitions someday, <CHARNAME>.~
@152 = ~I am not sure that would actually solve anything. As much as I hate it sometimes, magic is part of who I am.~
@153 = ~I think my problem is that I lack the drive and ambition people like you have to make decisions for themselves and never look back. But I will try to learn by example, if you will allow me to watch.~
@154 = ~Not all dreams and dreamers are created equal, though. That's where ambition-whatever it is-makes the difference, I think.~
@155 = ~I'm not so sure that's always the right order. I think sometimes strength follows ambition, when people look for the tools to achieve their goals.~
@156 = ~I will, from now on.~
@157 = ~My favorite heroine, you look drawn. Is there anything I can do for you?~ [FWKLSY57]
@158 = ~Do what? What are you talking about?~
@159 = ~Sure! Clean my pack, sharpen my dagger, wash my laundry, mend my boots...~
@160 = ~You can bug off, I have no time to deal with you.~
@161 = ~I was thinking, would you mind if I gave you a small gift? I was the manager of the family's cosmetics account for a time and I learned quite a bit. I've been working on something that I think would look really nice on you.~
@162 = ~Hey! Are you trying to tell me I'm ugly?~
@163 = ~I didn't know you thought me homely...~
@164 = ~Things are bad enough for me without being mistaken for a whore.~
@165 = ~That sounds very nice.~
@166 = ~No! Nothing of the kind.~
@167 = ~No! Nothing of the kind.~
@168 = ~It's not like that at all. The effect should really be quite subtle.~
@169 = ~Please don't take this the wrong way... gods, I think you're beautiful enough as it is. I've been experimenting with a cream I had an apothecary create for me on our last trip, and I've worked a minor enchantment on it as well.~
@170 = ~It should work with your natural tone and facial structure, but it will soften some of the dirt of the road and, if my magic works correctly, it should make people even more susceptible to your suggestions. Nothing illegitimate, of course.~
@171 = ~Would you take it? I would really like to see it on you, if you don't mind...~
@172 = ~I would be honored. This is a very sweet thought, Kelsey.~
@173 = ~I will take your gift but I can't promise you I will wear it.~
@174 = ~I am uncomfortable with the idea of magical makeup, Kelsey. Perhaps another time.~
@175 = ~This was a foolish project. I'm not interested.~
@176 = ~Wonderful! Here you go. I hope you like it. I'm sorry there isn't more, but this is a new thing for me and I wasn't sure you would like it.~
@177 = ~Oh, I don't want you to feel pressured. I really just want you to have it. If there isn't a good time to try it on for a while, I understand. A lot of the fun is just in the making and the giving anyway.~
@178 = ~Oh. That's okay... you probably wouldn't have liked the color anyway. Sorry, I'll try to think of something better next time.~
@179 = ~Oh. That's okay... you probably wouldn't have liked the color anyway. Sorry, I'll try to think of something better next time.~
@180 = ~Well, I'm not a squire, you know. I had something a little different in mind, a little more in tune with my abilities.~
@181 = ~I don't understand what's gotten in to you... but if that's the way you want to play it, I can live with that.~
@182 = ~As I was saying... <CHARNAME>, can I do something for you?~
@183 = ~Do what? What are you talking about?~
@184 = ~Sure! Clean my pack, sharpen my dagger, wash my laundry, mend my boots...~
@185 = ~You can bug off, I have no time to deal with you.~
@186 = ~What makes you think any of us enjoy listening to your incessant bragging and strutting?~ [FWKLSY58]
@187 = ~You may swing a mean cudgel, but that hardly makes you anything special. Isn't there a god of bullying that would suit you better than Helm?~
@188 = ~Fine, I won't tread on your religion if you won't tread on my private conversations. Deal?~
@189 = ~Spending time in your company certainly keeps my mind busy. I haven't thought of my family problems for days now.~ [FWKLSY61]
@190 = ~Is that a good thing or a bad thing?~
@191 = ~Good. I need you focused.~
@192 = ~Oh, again with the whining. Really, knock it off.~
@193 = ~Good! I think I spend entirely too much time brooding over it. Between your friendship and your exciting lifestyle, I'm completely occupied.~
@194 = ~Yes, well, I have tried to be attentive to anything you need from me.~
@195 = ~Hey, fine, if you don't want to talk, you won't have to worry about me distracting you.~
@196 = ~Still, it galls me, the way Birinar drove me out. He reappears from nowhere, pretends he's comforting my mother, and she entrusts him with all of the important business decisions.~
@197 = ~I can remember, when my father was still alive, my mother would talk about how much of a punk Birinar had been growing up. His sudden death must have really clouded her judgement.~
@198 = ~Losing a loved one can be very troubling. Her brother may have provided the comfort of younger, happier days.~
@199 = ~Perhaps you should have been more assertive, as your father's son and heir.~
@200 = ~Maybe. But he seemed just as shifty and good-for-nothing as she described him when I met him, and he did nothing to change my opinion later.~
@201 = ~Birinar knows nothing. The company's profits have been dwindling since he showed up, and it's all I and a few loyal employees have been able to do keep him from ruining absolutely everything.~
@202 = ~And after a year or so, when I finally confronted her with a stack of evidence showing how his decisions were losing us money, she sided with him and they sent me away... seven, eight years ago? Gods, I've lost track!~
@203 = ~I think...I think that very soon, I will make my way back and settle this matter once and for all. Either wrest my father's legacy away from them, or wash my hands of it entirely.~
@204 = ~They're set up in a rather extravagant villa on the Deepwash. Perhaps you might accompany me, after we've worked through your problems? At the very least, perhaps we can get in some canoeing.~
@205 = ~It sounds to me like this uncle has poisoned your mother's mind. I would be honored to help you set things right.~
@206 = ~I am interested in the boat ride, I am not so sure I want to become part of some family feud. I have my own problems with relatives, so to speak.~
@207 = ~Do not speak so glibly of the future. We still have a long and dangerous road ahead of us.~
@208 = ~Doubtful. I am not interested in helping you win back some trading post or warehouse you were too weak to hold.~
@209 = ~It may just be that. Hopefully a little unity and good sense is all it will take to settle matters. Thank you for the offer, <CHARNAME>. You're very generous to support me like this.~
@210 = ~All right, we'll see the sights together. Who knows, perhaps I can settle everything while you select a pier to launch from.~
@211 = ~I know, that's what has kept my mind off of this little family squabble. But I think it's time I paid more attention to the big picture.~
@212 = ~Hey! That's a nasty thing to say. If you don't want to come along, then fine.~
@213 = ~I did assert myself! But my father left the trading company to my mother. I was fifteen anyway, nobody was going to take me seriously on my own.~
@214 = ~Can I speak to you a moment? About my family?~ [FWKLSY59]
@215 = ~Are all priests as petty and jealous as you are? I'm trying to have a conversation with a friend of mine. I don't see your name branded on her arm. Is there some reason you treat all of us like your property?~ [FWKLSY60]
@216 = ~Funny, I seem to be standing exactly there right now.~
@217 = ~As I was saying, spending time in your company certainly keeps my mind busy. I haven't thought of my family problems for days now.~ [FWKLSY61]
@218 = ~Is that a good thing or a bad thing?~
@219 = ~Good. I need you focused.~
@220 = ~Oh, again with the whining. Really, knock it off.~
@221 = ~Are you talking to me?~ [FWKLSY85]
@222 = ~Anomen, I didn't know you had a sense of humor.~ [FWKLSY86]
@223 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you listening to this nonsense?~
@224 = ~I will not be dragged into this insane posturing.~
@225 = ~Anomen is right, Kelsey. I am sick of you.~
@226 = ~Anomen, this is my group to lead, I will decide who goes and who stays, and you are both welcome to stay.~
@227 = ~I can't believe you are siding with this bully! You are obviously not the woman I thought you were.~
@228 = ~Well, at least you're being honest now. You're still an outrageous, overblown excuse for a suitor, though, if you think I'm going to keep my feelings to myself just because you don't like it.~
@229 = ~What?!?~
@230 = ~I'll do neither! You're obviously unstable, <CHARNAME>, and I will not wait around for you to unleash your next boyfriend on me!~
@231 = ~Don't flatter yourself. I... I never really thought you took me seriously anyway. I think you two are just PERFECT for each other.~
@232 = ~I can't believe we're going through with this...~
@234 = ~No, and I certainly would rather that the choice had been left up to me.~
@235 = ~I don't want to fight you, Anomen, but if you keep swinging that thing in my face I can put you in a world of hurt.~
@236 = ~Go ahead, if you must be children about this.~
@237 = ~Wait! This will settle nothing!~
@238 = ~Wait! This will settle nothing!~
@240 = ~No, and I certainly would rather that the choice had been left up to me.~
@242 = ~No, and I certainly would rather that the choice had been left up to me.~
@243 = ~Leading as dangerous and nomadic a life as you have recently, have you had much time to make and keep friends?~ [FWKLSY62]
@244 = ~Mostly among those I travel with, but yes, there are some I call "friend."~
@245 = ~Life is too unstable to count on anyone for long.~
@246 = ~Why, yes, despite all the blood and intrigue that surrounds me, I actually think I'm quite a people person.~
@247 = ~I don't have time to discuss my personal life.~
@248 = ~Oh, knock it off already. I don't enjoy these stupid chats.~
@249 = ~Of course, they say you should keep your friends close and your enemies closer, but I think we have done it the right way. Friends close, enemies in sight but in their place.~
@250 = ~It's strange. I always thought as I grew older that it would be easier to find true friends, but with a few notable exceptions, that has not exactly been the case.~
@251 = ~You didn't have many friends as a child, then?~
@252 = ~Truly, a sad story, but I have no time for the rest.~
@253 = ~No. Travelling with my father as much as I did, it was difficult to form any real sense of bond or trust with other children. And as sleazy as some of the traders my father did business were, some of their offspring were even worse. And they were the most available.~
@254 = ~I assumed, though, that as I settled down and controlled more of my own comings and goings that things would improve, but I mostly found that petty, cruel children grew up to be even worse as young adults.~
@255 = ~And when I started working with militias and adventure companies... well, you know that good men are hard to find. Camaraderie wasn't nearly as important as getting paid to most of them.~
@256 = ~How true.~
@257 = ~Look on the bright side, though... you didn't have to grow up with Imoen.~
@258 = ~I did have the good fortune to meet Bryan Linn on one excursion along the Sword Coast, although it was a couple of years before your adventures there.~
@259 = ~I joined up with some Turmish trading company and noble retinue, as a combination junior negotiator and guard. They didn't really know what to do with me, I think, but they were intrigued enough to have me travel with them for a time, and I was working cheap.~
@260 = ~Linn was making his home in Turmish although he was clearly not a native. After a few days he introduced himself to me and told me very matter-of-factly that he was a fellow sorcerer and wanted to help me.~
@261 = ~It was like an answered prayer. He taught me the discipline I had never learned, and some magical combat tactics as well. He really was my friend.~
@262 = ~But it didn't last. Just a few weeks into the trip, Bryan got caught up in some crossfire during a routine scuffle with bandits. It wasn't life-threatening, but it could have been, and he decided to retire before he caught an arrow in the eye.~
@263 = ~Well, better that your friend settled down rather than die in your arms or something equally terrible and poetic.~
@264 = ~That's the way it goes... see, people come and go.~
@265 = ~I hope you're not as cowardly.~
@266 = ~I know. But I miss him and his counsel... he's one of the few sorcerers I've ever met, at least that would admit to it. It's difficult having no peers, but I suppose you might understand that even better than I. At least we have each other, eh?~
@267 = ~Oh, I don't know. You can count on me, and I certainly believe I can count on you. Perhaps you'll have a chance to meet him one day, if we travel that far east.~
@268 = ~I don't think Bryan was a coward at all, just practical. He wanted to live and die on his own terms, not because somebody on his side couldn't aim straight.~
@269 = ~Another joke at my expense... from what I know I would have considered myself lucky.~
@270 = ~I can understand why you might feel that way, but if you don't mind a little random flattery, I think you're a good counter-example.~
@271 = ~Hah! Cleverly put. You certainly have a way with some people I know.~
@272 = ~I thought you might welcome the distraction. Very well.~
@273 = ~Then I will not bother you again.~
@274 = ~I like to think of myself as agreeable... I don't come across as particularly hostile or dangerously angry, do I?~ [FWKLSY63]
@275 = ~Are you kidding me? Sometimes I think we should check your pulse to make sure you still live.~
@276 = ~I would not say you are irate by nature, no.~
@277 = ~You seem at least as edgy as the next guy.~
@278 = ~You come across poorly in general, leave me be.~
@279 = ~Well, I may not be the biggest or the strongest, but we have fought side by side, surely I have made some sort of impression on you.~
@280 = ~I wonder why it is that so many of the spells I cast are designed to hurt people. Especially before I met Bryan and he taught me how to better shape my magical energy to better protect myself, most of what I could do was designed for death and destruction.~ [FWKLSYD0]
@281 = ~What does that say about me? That instinctually, I want to cause pain? I think I could have better dealt with the onset of my abilities if I first was able to see in the dark or put people to sleep.~ [FWKLSYD1]
@282 = ~But no, I found out one day, entirely by accident, that I could start my hands on fire and burn anything nearby to a crisp. Terrific, right?~
@283 = ~Don't knock it, fire is a powerful tool.~
@284 = ~I can certainly see how that would be unnerving, but it's not as though you grew a third arm.~
@285 = ~Can you not whine to someone else?~
@286 = ~I'm sure it sounds like great fun, but when you're a fifteen-year old kid, it is a terrifying power, not to mention an unbelievable temptation.~
@287 = ~It is a very difficult feeling. I can defend myself and my friends against threats, and I feel good about that. But it has its costs. Do you have any idea what it feels like to constantly be able to shoot a deadly ball of flame across a room at a moment's notice?~
@288 = ~Sometimes, I'm tempted to do it just to see what happens. Isn't that awful?~
@289 = ~It should feel like a rush of power, Kelsey. Loosen up.~
@290 = ~Perhaps you were simply destined to be valuable in dangerous times.~
@291 = ~I am sorry it troubles you so.~
@292 = ~Loosen up? How can you say that, <CHARNAME>? Haven't you been listening to me at all?~
@293 = ~I can't stand being this dangerous! I feel like my own worst nightmare, like someone who can't be trusted, who is a threat to himself and everyone around him, and you tell me to loosen up?~
@294 = ~I... have an incredible headache right now, so I am going to stop talking to you now before I say something I don't really mean.~ [FWKLSYD2]
@295 = ~Oh, yes, I am certain that's it. I was destined to be here to shoot bolts of death at your enemies when it suits you.~
@296 = ~Lucky me. What would I have done if <CHARNAME> had not brought the wrath of the world my way? I would have been useless.~
@297 = ~You say that now, but honestly, <CHARNAME>, I don't think you would have me around if I wasn't a walking bringer of death for you.~
@298 = ~I don't think you really care how I feel. I'm just another piece on the tactical map to you.~
@299 = ~Truly? Perhaps my own perspective on my soul is out of focus, then.~
@300 = ~I thought of myself as a fairly calm and friendly person, but you may be right. Perhaps that explains why so much of the magic I developed, before Bryan taught me how to better shape it, was designed to hurt and to kill.~
@301 = ~Could be. You really should learn to relax.~
@302 = ~Indeed. Everyone's soul has a dark side, magic may be how yours expresses itself.~
@303 = ~Only cowards dither about their obvious strengths.~
@304 = ~It's hard to relax when you've been shooting fire out of your fingertips on command for the better part of a decade, <CHARNAME>. I do seem to be getting used to it, which is scary in itself.~
@305 = ~That doesn't mean I have to like it. Yet I seem to be good at what I do. I feel like whatever blackness is guiding my magic is also being fed by that same magic, and I am defined more and more by it.~
@306 = ~I don't agree at all. You are more than just your magic.~
@307 = ~If you don't like your life, change it. Nobody is stopping you.~
@308 = ~Well, complaining to me isn't going to help much.~
@309 = ~Really? I think you only let me travel with you because my magic is useful. In your eyes, I may as well just BE a fireball.~
@310 = ~I'm going to stop talking now before I make the mood even worse.~ [FWKLSYD3]
@311 = ~That's easier said than done, when everything and everyone around me just sees an asset or a pawn or a throwaway.~
@312 = ~You see what I mean? If I go beyond following orders and casting spells, nobody wants to hear about it. I'm not even a person to you anymore.~
@313 = ~I think you are on to something. I used to fear that the magical energy had to come from somewhere, and it was coming from my soul, that I was somehow burning it up. Perhaps you're right.~
@314 = ~Coward? I won't pretend I have the glory or recognition you and some of your famous friends have earned, but I don't think a little introspection is cowardly.~
@315 = ~I look at myself, and I see a man who is growing comfortable with power, maybe too comfortable.~
@316 = ~Fine, I'll discuss my thoughts with someone else and leave you to yours.~
@317 = ~I owe you an apology. I have been very inconsiderate. You have been a good and understanding friend and I snapped at you. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.~ [FWKLSY64]
@318 = ~It's all right. I can tell when someone is truly angry and when someone is just letting off steam.~
@319 = ~You are quite right, you were inconsiderate. Just what is it you expect from me?~
@320 = ~Forget it, brother. Tell it to someone else.~
@321 = ~No, no, I do not want to use an easy excuse.~
@322 = ~There is no excuse for turning on people who are only trying to listen and be helpful, but that is what I did to you.~
@323 = ~I don't think I realized how lonely I have been these last few years, with very few friendly faces to talk to, until we met.~
@324 = ~I trust you, <CHARNAME>, and I feel like I can talk to you about anything. I WANT to talk to you about anything, <CHARNAME>. I just forgot that courtesy isn't only for listeners, it's for talkers as well.~
@325 = ~So I can only hope you're still willing to talk... and to listen.~
@326 = ~No, I cannot put up with this.~
@327 = ~Against my better judgement, I'm still listening.~
@328 = ~It will take more than a few cross words to make me stop being your friend, Kelsey.~
@329 = ~Thank you... I will try to earn your continued patience.~
@330 = ~I think the worst part is that I did not mean what I said about being unappreciated.~
@331 = ~On the contrary, you are the best friend I have had in a long time, and I feel more accepted here than I have... well, probably anywhere, since I developed my magic.~
@332 = ~Why have you been so nice to me? It can't just be for the magic, you could have someone else stand back here and cast spells at your enemies.~
@333 = ~Why? Why not? Don't spoil it.~
@334 = ~Because I like you, Kelsey, and I value your company.~
@335 = ~Because I think there's probably a special person under all that angst, and I'm trying to dig him out.~
@336 = ~Now that you ask, I can't think of a good reason.~
@337 = ~Okay, you're the boss, boss.~
@338 = ~I... like you a lot too, <CHARNAME>.~
@339 = ~Ahem. I shouldn't distract you for long stretches like this... lead on.~
@340 = ~Ah, so I'm a project? Sounds good to me! Let me know when you find something in here you like.~
@341 = ~I think I have just asked one question too many... a traditional deal-killer. (sigh)~
@342 = ~I am glad to hear it. Hopefully I will not test those limits again.~
@343 = ~I should know better. I only hoped that by talking through my problems with a friend, I would feel better, but I got out of control.~
@344 = ~I see I dug the grave for our relationship...~
@345 = ~Aerie, have you given any thought to what you want to do when you grow up?~ [FWKLSY93]
@346 = ~I am very sorry, Aerie. I did not mean it that way, I only meant that... well, I know you were a slave in the circus and that the wide-open world is new to you, and I wanted to know if you had any idea what you want to do with your freedom.~
@347 = ~Please don't cry, Aerie, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, I'm just interested in what you're going to do now that... now that you are free to choose as well as any of us can.~
@348 = ~Maybe if you start with what you're good at? Or what you like to do?~
@349 = ~Hah! I'm afraid I don't know either, Aerie. And unlike you, I can't even do anything really useful like cure sick people. I certainly don't want to travel with MY uncle.~
@350 = ~Why don't we make a deal? I will tell you if I think of any good career opportunities for you, and you tell me if you can think of something that would suit me. Deal?~
@351 = ~I cannot decide if I think the world is entirely too big or entirely too small.~ [FWKLSY65]
@352 = ~On the one hand, there are races and civilizations all over the land, and below it, and above it. On the other hand, they all seem to object to our continued existence and know where to find us.~ [FWKLSY66]
@353 = ~It is a dangerous life we lead, no argument here.~
@354 = ~The world isn't big enough to keep you from pestering me, it seems. Take a hike.~
@355 = ~I cannot make the world a safer place, I can only hope we survive.~
@356 = ~Land, sea, or air, I am not afraid of conflict, you should know that by now.~
@357 = ~I worry about you. I know that you are capable and strong and don't really need my concern, but I don't want to see anything happen to you.~
@358 = ~Yeah, right. Admit it, you're afraid for your own skin!~
@359 = ~Your concern is touching, in its way, but hardly necessary.~
@360 = ~I appreciate that, Kelsey, but I think we do a good job of looking out for each other.~
@361 = ~It's nothing like that at all! <CHARNAME>, if I was afraid for myself, could I not have left already? This is not a buildup to a resignation speech, I am trying to tell you how I feel about you.~
@362 = ~I am... very fond of you, and I want to know you better and perhaps... grow even more fond of you. But I can't do that if the Eleventh Ogre Battalion crushes you under a rockslide because they don't like your hairstyle, so I'm just saying that I hope nothing like that happens.~
@363 = ~I know that you have to be yourself, and current circumstances seem to demand a large dose of aggression and violence. Just promise me that you'll remember that someone enjoys seeing you in one piece after a battle, okay?~ [FWKLSYD4]
@364 = ~As long as you do the same for me, we have a deal, trader Kelsey.~
@365 = ~I had no idea you cared so much.~
@366 = ~Don't be so naïve. Death will come for all of us, sooner or later. Your wishes don't hold much weight.~
@367 = ~So we do!~
@368 = ~Meeting you has given me a much more positive outlook on life. That's why I resent these dark clouds that hang over us so much. They're getting in the way of the light I've only started seeing recently.~
@369 = ~So! If you do see that hypothetical Ogre Battalion, let's run the other way, shall we? I'll cover our strategic withdrawl with a cleverly placed fireball and we can sneak away in the confusion. There's no sense in dirtying your pretty features in a fight we don't actually need to fight, right?~
@370 = ~Well, I do.~
@371 = ~You can be a fatalist if you like, just be a careful one and I'll be satisfied.~
@372 = ~It seems to me that makes it all the more worth saying, so I will say it again. I don't want to see anything happen to you.~
@373 = ~I... think we make a pretty good team too, <CHARNAME>.~
@374 = ~Fine, keep your own counsel, then.~
@375 = ~I know it well. I am somewhat concerned, <CHARNAME>, that your eagerness to prove your strength sometimes puts you in harm's way unnecessarily.~
@376 = ~<CHARNAME>? What are you thinking?~ [FWKLSY67]
@377 = ~Nothing, really. Just trying to focus on the road ahead without actually thinking about it too much, you know?~
@378 = ~I'm glad you asked, but to be honest, it's nothing I can really place into words. Things seem like such a jumbled mess sometimes.~
@379 = ~I'm thinking that I'm sick of the sound of your voice, loser.~
@380 = ~I'm thinking about death, vengeance, a glass of wine and being on the receiving end of a long backrub, in no particular order.~
@381 = ~Well, I've been doing some thinking, and it seems to me that you and I have something in common, and I was hoping we could talk about it.~
@382 = ~Oh? What's that?~
@383 = ~Don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think we're all that much alike.~
@384 = ~Yes, we both have the same problem--you. Go try your pitiful lines on the courtesans, I don't get paid enough to listen to this.~
@385 = ~Being... what I am is not easy for me. Magic is a weird thing, but most mages know all about how it works, because they study constantly trying to figure it out. For me, it's a piece of cake.~
@386 = ~Think of any powerful wizard in the Realms. He might have enough power to slay a whole army, but he has to prepare carefully. If he wants to disintegrate someone today, he had to be planning it last night. Same thing with casting a fireball, or hurling a ball of glue. Those guys have to plan.~
@387 = ~But me? I wake up every morning, and sometimes it's like I can FEEL this overload of magical energy soaking my body, and I can do almost anything I want with it. No preparation, no nothing.~
@388 = ~And every so often, I go to sleep, wake up, and I know how to shape that energy in a new way. I'm told that for every sorcerer it's a little different, but we consciously and subconsciously shape the new spells we "learn" based on what we know and what we want in life.~
@389 = ~Is this going somewhere?~
@390 = ~Kelsey, honey, you're getting all worked up... what are you trying to say?~
@391 = ~My point is--you know what this is like too, don't you? You've had power come upon you in a rush, taking you by surprise, right? You've had to deal with this just like me!~
@392 = ~Yes, Kelsey, you're right. I'm a child of Bhaal, and although it's not always a walk in the park, it has had some fringe benefits.~
@393 = ~Yes, Kelsey, I guess that's true enough, I have grown stronger over time, but that's easy enough to deal with.~
@394 = ~I don't know what you're talking about.~
@395 = ~What's it like, for you? How did you find out about your powers?~
@396 = ~It's unpleasant for me to think about, Kelsey. It's enough that you know I have them.~
@397 = ~They came to me in dreams. Very unpleasant ones. And when I woke up, I just knew how to do new things by thinking about them. It became second nature after a while.~
@398 = ~I see. Do they ever scare you? Do you worry about what using them does to you? My powers kind of scare me. When I was younger, I used to hope that it would fade as I got older, or if I just cast one more magic missile at a tree I could use up all the power for good and it would never come back.~
@399 = ~But, of course, that didn't happen... on the contrary, the more I use my magic, the more power I GAIN over time. So I have to wonder... if my magic is getting stronger, where is that power coming from? What am I giving up in return?~
@400 = ~I can't answer that, Kelsey. But I don't think you're inhuman or a monster or anything like that.~
@401 = ~Magic can certainly corrupt people, but I think you're a good person and it's not a problem. And I'll slap you silly if I see you stray, ok?~
@402 = ~I don't know. Power carries the responsibility of vigilance. No one can watchdog you better than you can.~
@403 = ~I'm glad to hear you say that. I know it sounds silly, but it's nice to know that I'm not alone. You make me feel like I'm not alone. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@404 = ~I suppose you're right. I hope you don't mind me bothering you about this, but it helps me to know that someone else might understand how I feel.~
@405 = ~<CHARNAME>... I'm almost certain that you're one of Bhaal's children. I've seen you in action, I've heard stories about Sarevok and Baldur's Gate. And that gives you certain special powers, doesn't it? Things ordinary people can't do?~
@406 = ~I had hoped to protect you from my secret, but yes, I am a child of Bhaal.~
@407 = ~You're quite the detective, Kelsey. I plead guilty and throw myself upon the mercy of the court.~
@408 = ~Why, you little snake in the grass! Mind your own damn business!~
@409 = ~I just wanted to have a mature conversation, but I guess I had you pegged wrong. Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.~
@410 = ~Oh! Maybe I can help you with some of the items towards the end of that list, if you don't mind, but first...~
@411 = ~I am truly a lucky man to be in your company and on your good side.~ [FWKLSY68]
@412 = ~Despite your incredible good looks and pleasant countenance, you're a terrifying leader in combat. I'm amazed most of our enemies even bother getting up in the morning anymore.~ [FWKLSY69]
@413 = ~Did anybody ask you? Stop bothering me with these nonsense blabbings.~
@414 = ~Awww, that's the nicest thing anyone's said to me all week.~
@415 = ~When it comes to my enemies, I have no room for sympathy. They deserve what they get, no matter what you or they think about me.~
@416 = ~I'm glad we got to know one another as friends instead of enemies as well.~
@417 = ~Fine, I'll do that.~
@418 = ~Do you remember the first time you were in a real fight? Not just where you raised your hand in anger, but where you were fighting for your life?~
@419 = ~Not long before Gorion died... but there has been so much fighting since that the specifics are all a blur now, Kelsey.~
@420 = ~It was just after Gorion was killed. Imoen and I did what we had to in order to stay alive.~
@421 = ~I'm tired of these pointless chats. Leave me in peace.~
@422 = ~I imagine it was very hard for you, being so sheltered by Gorion for all those years... but who am I kidding? My damsel in distress defeated an army almost single-handedly and turned the Sword Coast upside down!~
@423 = ~I'll never forget the first time I really tried to kill someone. For a while after I started developing my spells, I would use them for show, for practice...~
@424 = ~Every once in a while my family or a caravan driver we'd be working with would ask me to fire warning shots at a suspicious gang in the distance, or I'd go on a hunt or defend against an attacking wild animal.~
@425 = ~Then what happened? Obviously you got into more personal confrontations.~
@426 = ~Get to the point, please.~
@427 = ~One day, however, when I was minding one of our shops in Westgate, a pair of bandits strode in, full daylight, and started breaking up the place. There were a couple of customers but no guards on duty or nearby, and I was afraid for their lives and for mine.~
@428 = ~Without thinking, I fired an Acid Arrow spell at the closer bandit. It was a spell I had just realized I could cast a couple of weeks earlier, and I wasn't aware of its full potential yet.~
@429 = ~The arrow, by freak chance, caught the bandit full in the neck, and the magic acid I'd created out of thin air did its work, very quickly.~
@430 = ~The image... I can't get the sight of that man's neck dissolving out of my head, but the sounds were worse. Oh, <CHARNAME> it was horrible.~
@431 = ~Ugh, Kelsey, stop. This is too much.~
@432 = ~Go on, I'm still listening if it helps you to talk about it.~
@433 = ~(Shudder) You're right, I shouldn't make you think about such things. I'm sorry, I'll try not to be so morbid.~
@434 = ~The noises he made... I can't even describe them. Anyway, his "friend" stopped slapping around a lady in the store to see what had happened.~
@435 = ~I think he expected that I was getting what I had coming to me. When he saw his friend's head... disintegrating, he turned white almost instantly and passed out.~
@436 = ~The customers in the store weren't exactly pleased with the sight, either. It took quite a while for the guards to revive the other bandit and his would-be victim.~
@437 = ~Oh, Kelsey, that IS horrible. I'm sorry I can't help you erase that painful memory.~
@438 = ~Well, I'm glad to see that the experience toughened you, at least.~
@439 = ~I've got enough death to deal with in one day... please, no more.~
@440 = ~Once the adrenaline wore off and everything was almost back to normal, I had a chance to really think about what had happened, how I had sent someone to a terrifying death.~
@441 = ~I became hysterical. I wanted to kill myself, I wanted to find a way to get rid of my powers or make a deal with myself to never use them again for any reason. Even though he was in the wrong, I ended his life, and not humanely by any stretch of the imagination.~
@442 = ~You did what you had to do to protect yourself and others, there's nothing wrong with that.~
@443 = ~It pleases me that you did not intend or revel in his suffering, but his death is not your fault, Kelsey.~
@444 = ~He messed with the wrong man. I'm proud of you for making him pay.~
@445 = ~If your response had been any less severe, all you would have done is tell the world that you were a weakling and a pushover.~
@446 = ~I know that, now. But it made me more afraid than ever of what I could be capable of, and how I could really hurt someone I love if I don't direct my powers carefully.~
@447 = ~I care about you, <CHARNAME>, and I could never forgive myself if I failed you, or hurt you in any way. Thank you for listening... I've never been able to tell that story to anyone before.~
@448 = ~Really? I suppose you're right. I've certainly done much more violent things to much more violent people since then, but as I think back, I can't help but think that I overreacted, that I panicked, or worse, that I really was just looking for an excuse to kill someone in the heat of battle.~
@449 = ~Don't get me wrong. I care very much about you, <CHARNAME>, as well as your quest, and I would do almost anything you ask to help you.~
@450 = ~But as I think back to that sixteen year old sorcerer and the dissolving bandit... I sometimes wish the world was a safer place for you and I, that's all.~
@451 = ~Yoshimo, I am going to try very hard not to offend you...~ [FWKLSYB7]
@452 = ~...but I thought your culture believed very strongly in the concept of honor. What honor is there in pickpocketing and shoplifting? You're a strong, clever man that people seem to like, couldn't you find something else to do with those assets?~
@453 = ~That's nonsense. If you steal, you steal.~
@454 = ~And return her for a sizeable fee to whomever claims her, no doubt.~
@455 = ~Uh, no, not really, I think it should stay where it belongs, where good money has paid to put it.~
@456 = ~I'll do my learning somewhere else. You're not selling me, Yoshimo. It looks to me like you've stolen more golden lions than fair-haired maidens in your day.~
@457 = ~I don't suppose you and I could simply grab a good book and lock ourselves up in a cabin for a day or two and let everything blow over, could we?~ [FWKLSY70]
@458 = ~Well--~
@459 = ~Of course not. That wasn't a real question, I am surprised I even said it out loud.~
@460 = ~I realize that what we are doing together is important, <CHARNAME>. But I worry about you. I worry that Irenicus and guild wars and intrigue are wearing you thin.~
@461 = ~What makes you think I am so weak?~
@462 = ~I can handle it. It sounds to me like we're talking about your problems.~
@463 = ~I appreciate your concern, Kelsey, but we will get through it all.~
@464 = ~Stash your concern in a cool dry place, sorcerer.~
@465 = ~Weak? No, you are one of the strongest people in Faerun. But everyone has limits, everyone faces exhaustion.~
@466 = ~I have been watching you, as you sleep, these past few evenings. You do not sleep well, even if you feel you wake refreshed.~
@467 = ~Your face starts so peaceful and beautiful, and then I see the dreams come. Dreams, I imagine, of Irenicus and what he has done, or worse... and I see the way your face twists.~
@468 = ~Whether it is recollection or premonition that your dreams torture you with, I do not know, but I do know they torture you. And I want to make that stop.~
@469 = ~Perhaps I would sleep better if I wasn't being spied upon!~
@470 = ~I assure you, I am Irenicus's worst nightmare, not the other way around.~
@471 = ~Dreams can bring power and knowledge as well as pain. I do not fear them.~
@472 = ~I am truly touched by your concern, but all we can do is press on.~
@473 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not spying, I am worried! Is it so bad that I want to look at you? Or that I am concerned by what I see?~
@474 = ~The fact remains, when I look at you I am not seeing someone enriched and enlightened by sleep, I see someone I care about in great pain.~
@475 = ~I want to help you solve your problems with more than fireballs and strategic counsel. I want to help you feel better, <CHARNAME>.~
@476 = ~Your concern for me is enough. I feel better already.~
@477 = ~Then sleep a little closer this eve. Your presence, and your watchful eyes, are not unwelcome.~
@478 = ~You are doing everything you can, if not too much, Kelsey. I can take care of myself beyond that. ~
@479 = ~...all right, <CHARNAME>. I am sorry if you feel I am being too pushy. If the worst thing I do all week is to care too much about you, I can live with myself.~
@480 = ~Oh! I would be... let's see. I think I would be honored, ecstatic, and thrilled.~
@481 = ~And, uh, I'll also be discreet.~
@482 = ~Why are you fighting me so much? I am only trying to show that I care, and to help you. But I will try to give you your space.~
@483 = ~I do not doubt that he will only live to regret your next meeting with him... I have faith in you.~
@484 = ~Perhaps your nature allows you special powers in the land of dreams. If so, perhaps you are lucky, perhaps these dreams affect you less than they would someone else.~
@485 = ~Aye, I agree, because hiding in that cabin would solve nothing.~
@486 = ~While I am certainly more challenged here than I ever have been before, no, I am really talking about you.~
@487 = ~I hope so. But I know that even someone as special as yourself does not have limitless endurance.~
@488 = ~You have some real intimacy issues, <CHARNAME>, and I just can't deal with this anymore.~
@489 = ~I feel that you and I have really grown, as people, in the time we have been together.~ [FWKLSY71]
@490 = ~I can tell that we've also grown as adventurers. We have better equipment, we perform better in combat. As well we should, because the challenges only seem to become more serious.~
@491 = ~But our current problems will only be problems for so long. I wonder just how easy it will be to turn it off once we finally have Irenicus out of your life.~
@492 = ~Who said anything about turning it off? I plan to keep growing my powers.~
@493 = ~What we learn is just a part of who we are. I don't see it becoming a problem.~
@494 = ~I am sure we will not abuse our powers the way others have.~
@495 = ~I am sure we will not abuse our powers the way others have.~
@496 = ~I haven't seen any improvement in you, particularly in these inane interruptions.~
@497 = ~To what end, <CHARNAME>? The way I see it, our powers can be used to defend, or to destroy. If no one is threatening you, what then?~
@498 = ~You are incredibly naïve if you think I put all this together just because of Irenicus. I have plans that will make Sarevok look short-sighted.~
@499 = ~One never knows where the next threat will come from, Kelsey. I prefer being prepared.~
@500 = ~Strength can be used to defend others, as well. We can do much for the defenseless.~
@501 = ~Knowledge is its own reward? Perhaps.~
@502 = ~I know you make good use of the tools at your disposal, <CHARNAME>. But I worry about what may come.~
@503 = ~<CHARNAME>, it seems to me that we are already abusing our capabilities.~
@504 = ~If you hated the sound of my voice that much, you could have said something earlier.~
@505 = ~I see that what I feared has already begun. I will leave you to your scheming, but I cannot endorse it.~
@506 = ~Pragmatic, as I would expect from my favorite heroine. But I doubt we are the first to think such a thing.~
@507 = ~It seems to me that abusing power is not just about having bad intentions.~
@508 = ~Perhaps you are stronger than I, but I sometimes think about the ways I could use my magic for personal gain, or just a cheap reign of terror.~
@509 = ~I... I don't know that I wouldn't rather settle down with you at some point, rather than marching up and down the countryside righting wrongs.~
@510 = ~It's a good thought, but I think it has its own risks.~
@511 = ~But certainly you've seen that people have accumulated power through research and gone on to cause terrible destruction, intentional or not.~
@512 = ~I'm not exactly comfortable with all of the decisions we have made, and that makes me even more concerned about the future.~
@513 = ~Are you truly not tempted?~
@514 = ~No. Truly. I use force when I must, not for fun.~
@515 = ~Of course. Nobody's perfect. But I am confident in my self-control.~
@516 = ~You do make it sound awfully inviting. I could control not only my own destiny, but many others.~
@517 = ~Right, because so far you have been put in situations where you must use force to survive.~
@518 = ~My point, exactly, is that without such a pressing need, we will idly exercise our powers for less-than-noble purposes, just because we can and we don't have anything to fear.~
@519 = ~I know it is extensive, because you have been through so much in a short period of time.~
@520 = ~But with forces even you don't fully understand guiding your power and your destiny, I fear what will happen when the imminent crisis is over.~
@521 = ~Please don't take offense if it sounds as though I doubt you or your sincerity.~
@522 = ~I believe in you, <CHARNAME>, and I think that as long as we stick together, we can keep each other on the right path.~
@523 = ~Ack! That was not my intention at all! <CHARNAME>, please don't give in to the greed for power.~
@524 = ~I...I will do my best to be strong and help you overcome the temptation.~
@525 = ~I told you about my family, but I'm ashamed of myself, I did not once mention my brother.~ [FWKLSY72]
@526 = ~Why is that? Is he dead?~
@527 = ~Are you still talking to me? Take your foolish tales elsewhere.~
@528 = ~Tell me about him now, then, if it's important to you.~
@529 = ~No, my brother isn't dead. I just don't... think of him much.~
@530 = ~Fine, my foolish tales won't bother you any more.~
@531 = ~Yes, I think it is.~
@532 = ~Kelvim is my only brother, he is about seven years my junior. I think it was a bad gap of time. We were not so close of an age that we could play together, nor was I so much older than him that I could be like a second father to him.~
@533 = ~So we never really got to know each other. When I started travelling with my father on business, he stayed home with my mother, and I think that may have been the problem... we did not really share a bond through Father.~
@534 = ~When Father died, Kelvim was much more accepting of it. Perhaps because he did not know him as well.~
@535 = ~You can't blame your brother, he was just a child. Death is difficult enough to face for adults.~
@536 = ~Perhaps not. If your father was as kind as you make him out to be, that's Kelvim's loss.~
@537 = ~Are you going somewhere with this?~
@538 = ~No, no, I don't blame Kelvim for anything, he was quite mature and understanding for his age. Father was a real enough person to him, but he did not feel his loss because he was accustomed to his absence.~
@539 = ~I think what I'm really saying is that I envy everyone I see with strong bonds of family and loyalty. I haven't enjoyed them in a long, long while... not since Father died.~
@540 = ~I was already exhibiting my magic when Father died, which put a lot of people at arm's length, even Mother and Kelvim... and of course, you remember how she and my uncle sent me away.~
@541 = ~My father was not terminally jovial, but yes, he was a good man and it is a shame he and Kelvim did not really know one another.~
@542 = ~I envy loving spouses, I envy brothers and sisters I see playing in the streets, I even envy the obvious connection you and Imoen share, even if you think your foster sister was a brat sometimes.~
@543 = ~And I think there must be something wrong with me. I haven't even seen Kelvim for three years now, and we never grew close, even after he grew into more of a man. What's wrong with me?~
@544 = ~Nothing's wrong. Family can be a real bitch... you know all about my father and the mess he created.~
@545 = ~Everybody wishes they were nicer to their siblings or more respectful to their elders. Regret is a part of life, but keep it a small part.~
@546 = ~If you have something to say to your brother, say it to him. I can't help you with that.~
@547 = ~It sounds to me like you have some unresolved issues that should be resolved sooner rather than later.~
@548 = ~There is that. I don't think my feelings are quite as mixed as yours must be, but you're right. I am myself, not what my family makes of me.~
@549 = ~Still, I do have regrets. I think that some day, soon, I will take the time to get properly acquainted with Kelvim... as much time as it takes for brothers to sort these things out. Perhaps when your pressing matters are laid to rest, we might go see him, together...~
@550 = ~You may have a point. Do you think... oh, perhaps I should not put this off any longer. Should I go to him now? I would hate to leave our work half-done, but I don't know how much this feeling will nag at me now.~
@551 = ~You're making your own life here, Kelsey. Don't go until we've accomplished all that we set out to do together.~
@552 = ~It's your decision.~
@553 = ~Yes, I think you should go.~
@554 = ~You're clearly not going to be of any more use to me pining over these family problems. Go.~
@555 = ~You're right, darling. Leaving you now would be just another form of exile, and a whole new set of guilt to deal with. I will stay loyally by your side.~
@556 = ~Then... then Kelvim can wait. He's family, but you have given me so much more, and not out of blood obligations. I promise to stay focused on your needs for now.~
@557 = ~I am sorry I have become so distracted like this. But I think it will be for the best to finally try to lay these family demons to rest. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. I will listen eagerly for tales of my favorite heroine as I travel, and try to find you when I have made things right in my house.~
@558 = ~I envy loving spouses, I envy brothers and sisters I see playing in the streets, and above all I envy the obvious bond you and Imoen have, even if you do deny it sometimes.~
@559 = ~Can I tell you a story? It's not a very pleasant one, but I really need to talk, and I want you to know more about me from before we met.~ [FWKLSY73]
@560 = ~I don't mind sad stories, just long ones.~
@561 = ~Certainly, Kelsey. I'm here for you.~
@562 = ~Frankly, no. I am not your mother and I am not your conscience and I am not interested.~
@563 = ~Two years ago, while working my way back from a long trip east, I signed on for a short term with a Cormyrian militia company.~
@564 = ~Shortly after I signed on, the group got a new commander, a man who exuded nastiness, named Pellan. In retrospect, I should have known something was up when the company lieutenant immediately got himself transferred out.~
@565 = ~We were assigned to patrol the Lake of Dragons, to check on the trading ships coming close to the shore, make sure nobody was running contraband, that sort of thing.~
@566 = ~Pellan started out plausibly enough but after a week or so it was clear he was harassing honest people for no good reason. Before long, he had us engaging in outright plunder. Then he upped the stakes to rape, then outright murder.~
@567 = ~Kelsey, I deal with enough death on a daily basis, can't we talk about something a little more pleasant?~
@568 = ~Sounds like a crooked man and a half.~
@569 = ~Sounds like a decent living.~
@570 = ~I'm sorry for mistaking you for someone who cares.~
@571 = ~...I'm afraid I don't have anything more pleasant in mind right now, but I will respect your wishes.~
@572 = ~He certainly was, but I... well, I'll get to that.~
@573 = ~Anyway, a few men started deserting, but Pellan had enough loyal to him that they were caught, and made into rather gruesome examples.~
@574 = ~I was hoping that we would meet up with another patrol and we could turn Pellan in, so I stuck it out at first because Pellan was content to let me get off with light duty. He would have me fireball ships when he was done plundering them. He liked to watch them burn.~
@575 = ~I tried to make sure the ships were deserted first, but even so, that sometimes meant he was putting people to the sword and then giving me the order. I couldn't take it anymore.~
@576 = ~So one night, when the company was asleep and Pellan's men were patrolling the outskirts of the camp, I gave him a taste of his own medicine. I fireballed his filthy tent.~
@577 = ~It was... so easy. It only took a second. The camp went into a panic, and the camp guards went rushing to help their screaming leader... it was the easiest thing in the world to just start walking away. I think I must have walked for nearly 24 hours before I finally collapsed.~ [FWKLSYD5]
@578 = ~The next few days are sort of a blur, but I know I finally came upon a village and got myself cleaned up and came to terms with what I had done. I never heard a word about it from anyone. I guess nobody mourned that bastard, which is as it should be.~ [FWKLSYD6]
@579 = ~I think you did the right thing, Kelsey. That sort of evil cannot go unpunished.~
@580 = ~Vigilantism is extremely dangerous, Kelsey. Pellan was a terrible man but it was not your place to pass sentence.~
@581 = ~It sounds to me like you wasted a potential ally with your high-minded notions. Way to go.~
@582 = ~That sort of corruption is unfortunate. I am sorry you found yourself in that situation in the first place.~
@583 = ~Well, try to be careful with your fireballs when you're in this party.~
@584 = ~I am relieved to hear you say that. Part of me has always known it was the right thing to do, but there is so much doubt... was it my place? Should I have done more to prevent the crimes I could not undo? Should I have just run?~
@585 = ~Life is so confusing. You make me feel at ease, though. Thank you.~
@586 = ~I tried to give someone else the chance, but they never came. They never came, <CHARNAME>! And I just couldn't stay there waiting for my number to be called to start robbing and killing innocent people. No... I am no executioner, but I do know when to take a stand.~
@587 = ~I am glad that I could tell you this story...I feel at ease around you, even if we do not always think alike. Thank you for listening, <CHARNAME>.~
@588 = ~That is a disgusting thought, and I don't care if you were kidding or not.~
@589 = ~It's more than unfortunate, it is inexcusable. Some people say that evil exists just to balance out the good. I don't see how that makes any sense. Why do the sinners feel like they have to balance out the saints, or even the normal nice people who just don't want to get robbed and killed?~
@590 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I don't really expect you to have an answer for that, and I'm sorry if I spoiled your mood. You really put me at ease, and I should try to return the favor more often.~
@591 = ~One way or another, I promise you that I will never let myself fall into that kind of situation again. And of course I'm careful...I wouldn't want my favorite heroine to get singed.~
@592 = ~Thank you for listening to my tale, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry if I spoiled your mood. You really put me at ease, and I should try to return the favor more often.~
@593 = ~How can you say something like that?~
@594 = ~With mad mages to hunt, friends to rescue and a rogue's gallery of old and new enemies to fight, can I ever truly have a place in your life? I sometimes feel like I'm fighting all of the forces of nature just to spend a peaceful moment at your side.~ [FWKLSY74]
@595 = ~My life was simple enough once, it can be so again.~
@596 = ~Of course, Kelsey. I cannot promise you my constant and undivided attention, but you are not far from my eyes and my thoughts.~
@597 = ~Perhaps. The world is a complex place, so I will make my battles where I must and take my comfort where I can.~
@598 = ~Stop fighting it, because you have never been and will never be a part of my life.~
@599 = ~That's a comforting thought...but...~
@600 = ~...but?~
@601 = ~But, truly, <CHARNAME>, how can I possibly compare in importance to Imoen, with whom you have shared so much? How can I ever possibly grab your attention away from the next thieves' guild war, or a supplicant from a town in need of a heroine?~
@602 = ~How can I ever seem important to someone whose very existence is the work of a god?~
@603 = ~I don't need you to be any of those people, I only want you to be yourself.~
@604 = ~Opportunities come and go, but some bonds are stronger. Relax, everything will work out.~
@605 = ~Jealousy is a real turn-off, Kelsey.~
@606 = ~Come to think of it, you are pretty insignificant. Away with you, pest.~
@607 = ~You really are special to me, you know? Thank you for being so understanding.~
@608 = ~Jealous? I suppose I am. You have enough problems without me complaining about being overshadowed by them, though. I shouldn't be making it worse...I'm sorry.~
@609 = ~I walked right into that one, I suppose. As you wish.~
@610 = ~I'm not surprised to hear you say that. It's just that...I have enjoyed our time together so much that I would hate to see it come to an end. Ever, if I can help it.~
@611 = ~Don't cling, Kelsey. I enjoy your company as well, but life is a long journey and I will not make you any promises.~
@612 = ~I have enjoyed our time together as well, and I do not think life will always be as chaotic as it seems now.~
@613 = ~Our time together ends when you fall in battle or stop being useful.~
@614 = ~I do not think of myself as the type who lives solely for the moment. I suppose that's my father's legacy, making me always think ahead to how today's actions affect tomorrow's prospects. But, if that is what I must do to keep pace with you, then that is what I will do.~
@615 = ~Oh. Pardon me for overstepping my bounds, then... I thought we meant something to each other, but I see I was wrong.~
@616 = ~I think I've told you too many tales of woe about the trading company and my time on the road. Although I'm happier now, with you, than I've ever been, I shouldn't give the impression that my life has just been one long waking nightmare.~ [FWKLSY75]
@617 = ~Why not? Mine has been.~
@618 = ~Well, you've only told me about the nasty and dreary parts.~
@619 = ~You are MY long waking nightmare. Get away from me.~
@620 = ~It saddens me that my bad attitude seems to be rubbing off on you.~
@621 = ~Really, it hasn't all been that bad. Some of it is just pleasantly routine. By your living-on-the-edge standards, there's no real adrenaline rush from talking a merchant into paying a 35 percent markup instead of just 30.~
@622 = ~Sometimes, a good trade can really improve someone's life. I remember a halfling I met way out in the northeast... Helman Whitewhittle. He sold a little of everything--scrimshaw, jewelry, trinkets. None of it was terribly good, as I remember, so we didn't have much to discuss.~
@623 = ~But in his little shop, I noticed that hung over every door was an absolutely gorgeous sling. He somehow wove these beautiful patterns out of horsehair into the leather straps, and the sling head itself was dyed as bright and fast as you can imagine.~
@624 = ~I asked him about them, and he said that they really took no time at all to make, he had perfected the weaving and the dying process was actually quite easy, he just crumpled the head and dunked it in a few different pigments and let the colors work themselves out.~
@625 = ~So, let me guess, this halfling became a sling millionaire or something like that, right?~
@626 = ~That doesn't sound like a very practical weapon.~
@627 = ~Er, yes, something like that.~
@628 = ~No, you wouldn't think so. But I was surprised.~
@629 = ~Thanks, Queen of Subtlety. I guess I'll go stand over here, then.~
@630 = ~Now, normally, you're lucky to be able to get much more than a few silvers for a battle-ready sling in a shop, because they're really not that hard to make. But these really were beautiful, and he proved that they were as sturdy and accurate as any.~
@631 = ~So I asked him to make a dozen and took them on consignment. He said he would take half of whatever I got. I'll be damned, but the total take for those dozen slings was close to a thousand gold! Some just wanted a little style in their rock-throwing, others wanted to decorate their doorways like old Helman had.~
@632 = ~We eventually made it a regular trade route item and arranged formal pricing and compensation. Those little slings are so popular I hear Helman has himself set up like a Calimshan pasha these days.~
@633 = ~So you made someone rich. That's hardly a noble accomplishment.~
@634 = ~It's nice to hear about one of the little folk making it big.~
@635 = ~Seems to me if those slings are so popular you should have just taken the design and made your own.~
@636 = ~It's nice to hear about one of the little folk making it big.~
@637 = ~There are certainly more noble callings than making or selling decorative slings, sure. But everybody gets a fair deal, everybody is happy, and nobody gets hurt. To my mind, that's not a bad way to live one's life.~
@638 = ~No kidding. Some people say they're not an industrious people, but if you'll pardon the expression, I think they sometimes just have a difficult time thinking big. He saw a pretty sling he knew how to make in his spare time, and never really thought anyone else would care.~
@639 = ~That wouldn't have been very honest, not to mention the fact that I still don't know how his dyes work, exactly. But that's not the point. Done right, trade should benefit everybody, not just the strong-arm. I may never be the richest with that attitude, but I will sleep at night.~
@640 = ~If you'll permit a dose of flattery, I would have thought you would feel content yourself, having made a name as an adventuress halfling. But yes, it was nice to help out someone who, if you'll forgive me, didn't really know how to think big about his potential.~
@641 = ~I know about Gorion and Imoen, but has there ever been anyone... you know, special... in your life before?~ [FWKLSY76]
@642 = ~I really don't think this is any of your business.~
@643 = ~Candlekeep was full of monks and old men, and you know how busy I have been since. What do you think?~
@644 = ~There was, after a fashion, but no one you know.~
@645 = ~If you mean what I think you mean, then no.~
@646 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, I do not want to make you uncomfortable but it is important to me that we are open with each other.~
@647 = ~If you must pry, then no, not in the way you mean.~
@648 = ~Yes, but it is not important now.~
@649 = ~I don't think this is worth talking about.~
@650 = ~I see. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I can't stand secrets, not like this.~
@651 = ~I think that you probably made some of those monks think twice about any vows they might have taken, but I can appreciate that you have not had much time or opportunity.~
@652 = ~I know that my flattery must sound ridiculous sometimes, <CHARNAME>, but you truly are such a delight to be with that I could hardly have blinked if you had told me you had scores of suitors.~
@653 = ~Maybe some bard or knight that lives for these speeches could say it better, but I can only say that... that you are more than I could ever want in a woman.~
@654 = ~Ahem. Fair is fair. Don't I get to hear about your past now?~
@655 = ~You know, I'm sorry I let you get me started on this. You're not worth discussing my love life with.~
@656 = ~Oh, of course. I meant to tell you, I just got distracted looking at you.~
@657 = ~Uh huh.~
@658 = ~Honest!~
@659 = ~Anyway, no, I am not "new" to women.~
@660 = ~I'm not exactly proud of all of it. In my younger days, shortly after I was sent on the road, I allowed a female buyer to use sex as a weapon, as a bargaining tool, and I succumbed. Then I did it again, just a couple of weeks later.~
@661 = ~That ruined my outlook for a while, I must admit. It didn't feel particularly right or special, nor was it exactly smart, so I learned how to stay out of those situations and tell people when I could see through them.~
@662 = ~Growing up in general helped, as well. Since then, well, I haven't done a very good job of following my father's advice when he told me that a man should never be too busy to fall in love or stay in love.~
@663 = ~I can't abide the "girl in every port" idea, so I don't do that.  But I have been travelling so much and with so many different people that there are few alternatives.~
@664 = ~I have tried to stay away from short-term relationships of convenience, but I will admit to sharing blankets and affections on a few cold nights with a like-minded woman on a caravan run.~
@665 = ~That said, I have been looking for somebody special, and I have really found her this time. You.~
@666 = ~I hope you're not too disappointed in me, <CHARNAME>.~
@667 = ~I would have hoped you were a stronger person.~
@668 = ~Not at all. I would be selfish to assume no one else had ever taken an interest in you.~
@669 = ~Quite a bit, as a matter of fact. Don't talk to me.~
@670 = ~What can I say? I wish I had been stronger too. Not to tell you sad stories, but it can really make a guy feel unloved when his father is dead and his mother rejects him.~
@671 = ~In any event, that is behind me now. I swear to you, I have not given any thought to anyone but you for some time now.~
@672 = ~Good!~
@673 = ~Then we will be fine.~
@674 = ~I'm watching you like a hawk, Kelsey, so you had better be telling the truth.~
@675 = ~Although, since I'm spilling my guts I should tell you about one more thing. There was this girl I met outside Nashkel once. Claimed she was a direct descendant of Sune's avatar... no, no, just kidding!~
@676 = ~I wish that it had not happened that way. I wish that I was a more noble man for you.~
@677 = ~I am very sorry I could not live up to your expectations, but I cannot change my past. Perhaps some day you will be able to accept me for who I am.~
@678 = ~I never wanted to make you uncomfortable, <CHARNAME>, but if I am that insignificant to you, then I will keep to myself from now on.~
@679 = ~I see.~
@680 = ~If you think I'm disappointed, I'm not. I would have been a little surprised at any other answer, actually.~
@681 = ~I understand. I am sorry you were so lonely, <CHARNAME>. You don't deserve the isolation you have had to endure.~
@682 = ~I feel... so peaceful right now. Thank you.~ [FWKLSY77]
@683 = ~What am I supposed to have done?~
@684 = ~Ummm... you're welcome?~
@685 = ~Glad to hear it.~
@686 = ~Oh, gods, are you still here? Shut up, already!~
@687 = ~You have listened, you have heard, you have helped me.~
@688 = ~I have been going over the last decade of my life, time spent learning about life, about business, then learning how to deal with loss, with betrayal, with rage... and I have decided that, on the whole, everything is all right now.~
@689 = ~For years, even when we first met, I have been brooding over my plans. I would save enough money, I would accumulate enough knowledge and power, to dispose of Birinar using any means necessary.~
@690 = ~But that can't be right. Even before I began adventuring with you, I'm sure I could have killed Birinar easily with just a spell or two, if I truly wished to.~
@691 = ~Or I could have forced a confrontation with my mother. There was nothing stopping me. I am a man grown, so if she chose not to listen to me now, it would be her final decision and there would be nothing more to say on the matter.~
@692 = ~None of that feels very important anymore. I admit that may never truly be satisfied about the death of my father, however.~
@693 = ~Yes, how exactly did he die? You have not been very explicit.~
@694 = ~You'll follow him shortly if you don't leave me alone for once.~
@695 = ~I still do not know. Just two months after I began casting, he was struck with a terrible weakness and could barely get out of bed. Within a week, he had wasted and died.~
@696 = ~The evening before, he had been healthy and even happy. I recall that we had a fight, when I thought he was making fun of my magic, but he laughed it off and said I was simply overwrought with the emotion of being fifteen.~
@697 = ~The healers could do little but prolong his agony. It was as though his entire body turned against him, or his life were being sucked out through a tube.~
@698 = ~The rumormongers worked quickly, insinuating that my sorcery proved that I was not his true son but some sort of demonic conception, and that I was draining my father with my spellcasting.~
@699 = ~And for a while, what could I do but believe them? He was dead, but there I was, stronger and more powerful than ever.~
@700 = ~My mother had very little to say on the subject. She had been more than a little afraid of me since I started casting. And that isolation just made it easier for my uncle to worm his way in and put a new, less scandalous face on the family.~
@701 = ~And you have gathered the rest. Birinar hatched the scheme to send me out as a traveling sales manager, away from where the decisions affecting the entire family business were being made.~
@702 = ~And I grew bored and drifted into side work, and then we met. Quite a long road, but worthwhile.~
@703 = ~In truth, I think I have been ready to move beyond my disappointment with them for some time now. But there was nothing else to fit the hole where my family had been.~
@704 = ~And now that emptiness is gone, is that what you're saying?~
@705 = ~I still say he should get it in the neck.~
@706 = ~Exactly. And that is why I thank you.~
@707 = ~Then you are welcome.~
@708 = ~Perhaps you should not write off your family entirely. We should try to look in on your brother some day.~
@709 = ~Birinar still sounds like he has a date with destiny at our hands.~
@710 = ~That was all I really wanted to hear.~
@711 = ~Yes, I do believe we should, but now is the time to work on your problems, <CHARNAME>. You have been more than supportive of mine.~
@712 = ~Ah, but my favorite heroine, that would not be very heroic. Birinar isn't worth killing. Let us speak of him no more, and I will be happy.~
@713 = ~There is definitely something wrong with you, <CHARNAME>... I will not open up to you any more.~
@714 = ~I don't know if I believe in fate, or that the ends justify the means, but I do know one thing. I would be a fool to complain about anything that has happened in my life, because it has brought me here.~ [FWKLSY78]
@715 = ~What is that supposed to mean?~
@716 = ~I am glad that we are together, too.~
@717 = ~Can it bring you somewhere else? I can't stand your chattering.~
@718 = ~I cannot think of anywhere, or anyone, I would rather be. And that is a difficult thing for me to say. Not because it isn't true, but because of what it means.~
@719 = ~I am... I am happy to be what I am. I think I hated being a sorcerer because I didn't know what to do with magic but dazzle or hurt people.~
@720 = ~But now, I can use magic to help you, and to protect you. I like that. It makes not understanding it seem a lot less important.~
@721 = ~I--what am I talking about? I love you, <CHARNAME>! I love you, and for some reason that makes everything else make so much sense.~ [FWKLSYD7]
@722 = ~I have a very good memory. It's one of the reasons I make a decent trader. It is also why I can tell you, without a doubt, that I have never been this happy.~ [FWKLSYD8]
@723 = ~I love you too, Kelsey.~
@724 = ~Those are very pretty words. Don't lose yourself in them.~
@725 = ~I am flattered, but I cannot return the sentiment. We should stay friends.~
@726 = ~I--you--I... I have been turned into a babbling idiot, I think.~
@727 = ~I should probably let you get back to the important business of running the group, otherwise I will do something silly like tickle you and repeat how much I love you.~
@728 = ~Why don't you, then?~
@729 = ~I love a man who knows his limits.~
@730 = ~Try it and I'll break your wrists. Nothing personal.~
@731 = ~I think we would get some funny looks from the latter... maybe some other time.~
@732 = ~But until then... I love you!~
@733 = ~Indeed, but I am learning that they are not nearly as limiting as I thought. I would have never suspected I could make this good of an impression on you before you helped teach me confidence.~
@734 = ~You scare me when you say things like that, <CHARNAME>...~
@735 = ~They are not just words, <CHARNAME>, I mean what I said. I do love you, but I understand if you do not feel you can return the words.~
@736 = ~Good. I like you, but I do not want to be pressured.~
@737 = ~I do love you as well, Kelsey, but words can be dangerous.~
@738 = ~I was not trying to confront you, <CHARNAME>. But I want you to know how I feel. I hope that I will be able to make you comfortable with me, in time...~
@739 = ~Not when they sound so right between two people, <CHARNAME>. If we love each other, what is the harm in saying so? I will say it again, just to tempt the fates...I love you, <CHARNAME>!~
@740 = ~I suspected you might feel that way. What can I do but agree, if that is the way you truly feel? I may have to give up, but I do not think I will stop loving you, not for a long while.~
@741 = ~And...to think...I was about to tell you how much I loved you! What was I thinking?~
@742 = ~I know...or I hope...well, I know I hope we have decades together to worry about this sort of thing, but do you ever think about the future, retirement, that sort of thing? What is at the end of the road for my favorite heroine?~ [FWKLSY79]
@743 = ~My road leads to a throne of blood and power over millions, starting with you.~
@744 = ~I do not have the luxury of looking much past tomorrow.~
@745 = ~I really don't know. I'll probably die in the saddle, so to speak.~
@746 = ~I would like to settle down some day, but that's a long way off. Gorion taught me a lot about living a more contemplative life.~
@747 = ~I hate to point this out, but because you are human, we may not still... be together when my retirement comes.~
@748 = ~I would like to settle down some day, but that's a long way off. Gorion taught me a lot about living a more contemplative life.~
@749 = ~Ummm...was that a tease, or a threat?~
@750 = ~A tease, silly.~
@751 = ~A threat. Watch your step, mage.~
@752 = ~Oh, probably a little of both.~
@753 = ~Ah. Well, I don't exactly think it's funny. All of this Bhaal business is scary enough for me, please don't lord it over me. It makes me uncomfortable.~
@754 = ~Oh, I'll be watching it from a much greater distance from now on. I care about you, but I won't be bullied.~
@755 = ~Me, I would like to have some sort of plan. I've already started saving up for the future, since I can't exactly count on inheriting the trading company and I don't want to go on that one adventure too many.~
@756 = ~I know that as a storyteller I'd probably make a great shopkeeper mage, but if you will please indulge me. I've been thinking about that future, and how I would like to see it turn out.~
@757 = ~Perhaps I'll start up a small shop of my own. Nothing ambitious, just a place where people can meet and gather and buy their spices and their breeches and gossip and giggle.~
@758 = ~We'll have a trophy case of our horde of treasure from our years on the road, and trade the odd piece with the adventurers that pass through town. You and I will swear that they're children, impossibly green, and that we were never that young, and you'll smile and I'll love you all over again.~ [FWKLSYF9]
@759 = ~Or perhaps I'll build myself a small rickety tower and go just slightly off-kilter, puttering around up there with potions and a familiar. You'll come and remind me every day that I should eat lunch and change my socks, of course.~ [FWKLSYD9]
@760 = ~And I see you. You'll be a beautiful silver-haired seer, consulted by the rich and the poor, the powerful and the meek about everything from romance to high diplomacy.~ [FWKLSYE0]
@761 = ~Everyone will love you and respect you and trust you. No one will care that your blood once made people suspicious and afraid. They will see a truly great, wise woman, and they will never forget you and your great deeds and your kindness and insight.~ [FWKLSYE2]
@762 = ~...I want to be there when that happens.~ [FWKLSYE3]
@763 = ~That's a very sweet story, Kelsey. I hope things really do turn out that way.~
@764 = ~We can only see what we shall see, my love.~
@765 = ~I hardly think that's likely. One or both of us could be dead by dawn.~
@766 = ~I'm in no rush to grow old, you understand, but I can't think of a better way to do it than with you.~
@767 = ~Perhaps, but I won't let your pessimism ruin my fantasy, <CHARNAME>. I believe in it.~
@768 = ~And I see you. You will have hung up your weapons and rings of power and battle gear, but you will still be strong and beautiful and vibrant.~ [FWKLSYE1]
@769 = ~Truly? You love The Life that much that you can't imagine doing anything else?~
@770 = ~More like I doubt there will ever be an end to my enemies.~
@771 = ~It is the best way to control my own destiny.~
@772 = ~Truly? I think I'm relieved to hear you say that. As strong as I know you are, <CHARNAME>, I would hope you would get out of harm's way before harm has its way.~
@773 = ~(sigh) As much as I try not to think about that... yes, I know, and as much as I hope to be with you forever, I hope that I don't become a burden to you before your time.~
@774 = ~Truly? I think I'm relieved to hear you say that. I think the world will need a break from you eventually, for its own good.~
@775 = ~I don't think there will ever be a better time to ask...please, come sit with me.~ [FWKLSY80]
@776 = ~Very well. What is on your mind, Kelsey?~
@777 = ~I am tired and in no mood for deep conversation.~
@778 = ~You know that I love you, and I have tried to show you that I am at your service on the battlefield and as a friend.~ [FWKLSYE4]
@779 = ~Now, I want to be more than that to you, <CHARNAME>. I would like...I would love...if we could spend the night together, as a man and woman.~
@780 = ~Being able to touch and hold your body...would be an honor, to say the least.~
@781 = ~I realize that this is probably not the most romantic setting, or the most seductive offer you could hope for, but please believe me when I say it is sincere, and I would not ask if I did not care deeply about you.~ [FWKLSYE5]
@782 = ~Will you take this step with me?~
@783 = ~Yes, Kelsey. I want to share our love this way.~
@784 = ~I don't think the time is right for this.~
@785 = ~This is so sudden...I don't know how I feel.~
@786 = ~Me? Sleep with a weakling like you? Not in this lifetime.~
@787 = ~I understand. I love you, <CHARNAME>, and I would never ask you to do something you did not truly feel.~
@788 = ~You know my feelings now, so if there is any way I can make you more comfortable with...the idea, please tell me.~
@789 = ~I do not need any more convincing, Kelsey. I will stay with you tonight.~
@790 = ~We shall see. Let's not rush anything.~
@791 = ~Keep on dreaming, because you will never be man enough for me.~
@792 = ~If you had so low an opinion of me as a man, why could you not mention something a little sooner? Damn you for being so cruel, <CHARNAME>!~
@793 = ~Please...I know I try upon your patience at times, but this is important to me and I will not be able to sleep unless we talk.~
@794 = ~All right. Speak your thoughts, then.~
@795 = ~I said I was tired and I meant it. Don't bother me.~
@796 = ~Then what I wanted is probably impossible anyway...as difficult as it will be, I will leave you to yourself from now on.~
@797 = ~I am glad you feel as I do. I will...do my best to be gentle, and everything you deserve in a lover...~
@798 = ~I can hardly disagree with your feelings. I do not resent your decision...but if you change your mind, please don't keep the news to yourself.~
@799 = ~Good night, dear <CHARNAME>. I think I will sit up a while longer.~
@800 = ~My dear, I believe I could lie here with you forever, but it is time to rise and face the day.~ [FWKLSY81]
@801 = ~Thank you for staying with me. It was wonderful.~
@802 = ~No need to thank me, I enjoyed it as well.~
@803 = ~Yes, well, we will have to do that again some time.~
@804 = ~Well, I would say there is some room for improvement.~
@805 = ~I hoped as much, <CHARNAME>. I did not merely want to please myself at your expense.~
@806 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>. There will be time enough to discuss this later, but I believe we have important work to do today.~
@807 = ~Oh, absolutely, <CHARNAME>. ANY time.~
@808 = ~Then we will simply have to try again sometime... soon.~
@809 = ~My dear, it is time to rise and face the day. I hope you are well rested.~ [FWKLSY82]
@810 = ~I hope you are not pouting about last night.~
@811 = ~Thank you, yes.~
@812 = ~I have not forgotten what you said to me. Some night soon we may not rest quite so well.~
@813 = ~Not at all, <CHARNAME>. I would be lying if I said I want you less this morning than I did last night, but there will be time enough to discuss that later. We have important work to do today.~
@814 = ~Then let us be on our way, <CHARNAME>. I believe we have important work to do today.~
@815 = ~Very little would make me happier, <CHARNAME>, but we should discuss it later. I believe we have important work to do today.~
@816 = ~Maybe this does not need to be said, perhaps I will jinx the magic between us, but I want you to hear it.~ [FWKLSY83]
@817 = ~I want you to know that I am devoted to you, and I hope to never leave your side. I truly want us to be together forever.~ [FWKLSY84]
@818 = ~I think I would like that.~
@819 = ~That's good, since I don't plan to let you out of my sight.~
@820 = ~Perhaps we should not get ahead of ourselves. Forever is a long time.~
@821 = ~It's not like you were so great in bed that I couldn't stand living without you.~
@822 = ~I think I would like that.~
@823 = ~That's good, since I don't plan to let you out of my sight.~
@824 = ~Perhaps we should not get ahead of ourselves. Forever is a long time.~
@825 = ~I am so fully satisfied here, in mind, spirit, and body, that I simply cannot ever imagine wanting or needing to be elsewhere.~
@826 = ~Are you asking me to marry you?~
@827 = ~Well, stay as long as you like, but I do not control the future.~
@828 = ~I do not believe that would be fair to you right now, <CHARNAME>...~
@829 = ~There is still so much that needs to be done to set things right, and I would be lying if I did not say that my own problems make me a little leery of marriage. "Family" has not been a good word in my vocabulary for a long time.~
@830 = ~For now, I think our relationship, as equals, is best. Perhaps we can discuss the idea when things have calmed down somewhat...~
@831 = ~I will. I hope that in time you grow to cherish the idea as much as I do.~
@832 = ~I know that! I am counting on it, in fact.~
@833 = ~That wasn't what I was getting at, <CHARNAME>, and I think you know it.~
@834 = ~I feel truly satisfied in mind and spirit with you, and I cannot ever imagine doing better elsewhere.~
@835 = ~Are you asking me to marry you?~
@836 = ~Well, stay as long as you like, but I do not control the future.~
@837 = ~I know that! I am counting on it, in fact.~
@838 = ~Korgan! Slow up, something just dropped out of your pack!~ [FWKLSYA2]
@839 = ~It's--a book?~
@840 = ~I can read a little dwarvish... "Collected Songs Of Mother Mountain"? My family does a little trade in books... a best-selling collection of dwarven poetry, and it's in YOUR pack?~
@841 = ~Now, relax. I'm sure no one needs to know, if you keep your voice down, and if you gut me now I'll make a lot of noise and they're liable to find the book when they pry it away from my bloody remains. Besides, even if asked, I'm sure I'd say you only have it for... sentimental value.~
@842 = ~I don't even have a sister. But here you are.~
@843 = ~When did you get used to killing-or-being-killed?~ [FWKLSYA9]
@844 = ~It is not a question of when, Kelsey. I don't think it's something you should ever get used to.~
@845 = ~I was... born for killing, Kelsey. I can't help it.~
@846 = ~I was born for killing, and I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@847 = ~Not long after Gorion's death, when I discovered that there were plenty of people who would never call me their friend.~
@848 = ~Hush, I'm thinking about more important things.~
@849 = ~I have to admit, I think I'm too used to it myself. I find it a little distressing that I've shaped so much of my magic towards hurting others, but then again, I have to thank countless magic missiles and acid arrows for my continued good health and cheer.~
@850 = ~Doing what you have to do is tough, but at least you get to live.~
@851 = ~Indeed. Plus, a lot of them probably have it coming.~
@852 = ~All you can do is hope, as I do, that eventually the world will be a more peaceful place.~
@853 = ~That's the spirit! Now, let's get back to work.~
@854 = ~I suppose I do. I don't want to live just to kill, though. I think that would be a terrible fate.~
@855 = ~Probably. But there are people who make war a game and killing a hobby, and I would hate to end up so accustomed to ending lives that I would feel the same way.~
@856 = ~I have my doubts, but it's a nice thought, <CHARNAME>.~
@857 = ~Gotcha.~
@858 = ~Born for killing? What does that mean?~
@859 = ~Nothing, forget it.~
@860 = ~It means I like to kill, and I start with those who ask me the most questions.~
@861 = ~Well, you HAVE seen how good I am at it, haven't you?~
@862 = ~It means I am the direct descendant of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, which supposedly entitles me to certain rights and responsibilities in the killing department.~
@863 = ~All right, never mind.~
@864 = ~That I have. It's impressive, but I'm not sure how I feel about saying that.~
@865 = ~What? And I thought I had a suspect bloodline. Uh, sorry, no offense, that wasn't what I meant!~
@866 = ~It's just that, well, I would have thought life would be very difficult for someone in that situation. But then, life HAS been difficult, hasn't it?~
@867 = ~You're a real master of the obvious, Kelsey.~
@868 = ~You could say that. But I assure you that I'm a fairly normal person despite my "suspect bloodline."~
@869 = ~It's getting more trying all the time.~
@870 = ~I'll try not to complain quite so much about not understanding my heritage in the future. And if you'd ever like to talk about it, just let me know.~
@871 = ~I just wanted to thank you for including me in the group. We're doing the kinds of things I believe in, and you're a much better person than the adventurers and mercenary captains I normally wind up with.~ [FWKLSYB0]
@872 = ~We aim to please, Kelsey. You've been a valuable asset.~
@873 = ~Try not to break your arm patting yourself on the back, boy.~
@874 = ~I don't mind helping people in need, but there's a bigger picture to stay focused on, here.~
@875 = ~I'll thank you to be included quietly.~
@876 = ~I'm glad to hear you say that. It's nice to be appreciated, rather than chided for not knowing this or that obscure spell, or not being able to swing an axe, or not having the agility to set 85 traps while suspended from a wire by my pinky toe.~
@877 = ~I wasn't trying to take credit for it, I was trying to complement--never mind.~
@878 = ~Of course, you call the tune, I'm just saying that I think it's been a good one. If there's one thing my father taught me, it's that a happy employee is a productive employee, so I hope you agree that I'm both.~
@879 = ~Sorry, boss.~
@880 = ~Have I told you how I wound up an adventurer?~ [FWKLSYB1]
@881 = ~No, and I don't have time for this.~
@882 = ~Not yet, but I suspect you're about to.~
@883 = ~No, but I'm curious.~
@884 = ~Perhaps another time.~
@885 = ~Well, as I think I mentioned, my family runs a fairly successful trading outfit, with posts and buyers across much of the human-settled world.~
@886 = ~My fifteenth year was a difficult one. I discovered my sorcery entirely by accident when I spontaneously lit my hands on fire. Despite the obvious comedy value, it was pretty scary for everyone.~
@887 = ~Not long after, my father died rather suddenly. I had worked closely with him for years, and my mother was an active part of the business as well, so between the two of us, we were prepared to keep things going.~
@888 = ~Truly, heroic beginnings. (yawn.)~
@889 = ~How does this lead to you becoming an adventuring mage?~
@890 = ~I'm really not interested in the rest of the details.~
@891 = ~Bear with me. So we ran the company well enough, I manifested a few extra minor powers and they came in handy to discourage some of the opportunistic liars who tried to muscle us after Father died.~
@892 = ~But then my uncle Birinar, my mother's younger brother, ingratiated himself to her and wound up taking over as a co-managing partner. He was never really good at anything, so we wound up doing more work to make up for his incompetence and he drew a nice salary.~
@893 = ~I couldn't convince her of his incompetence, though, and when I blew up at the both of them Birinar managed to convince Mother that I needed to get out and see the world, so they arranged to make me a sort of traveling sales manager.~
@894 = ~And now I'm stuck with you. Terrific, no more detail necessary.~
@895 = ~Sounds like you got a raw deal.~
@896 = ~Did I ever. Actually, I was able to do some good, but most of it was make-work to keep me away from the real action. And when it became clear that nobody really cared how fast I got to my next assignment, I decided to start taking the long way.~
@897 = ~I'd sign up with an adventuring expedition heading in that general direction, or offer to provide support to a provincial militia or ranging patrol.~
@898 = ~That usually worked, and got me where I was going more safely than traveling in a caravan with a few hirelings. Even in Amn, most captains are happy enough to have a mage on their side, licensed or not.~
@899 = ~So that's more or less the story of my life the past few years. Someday, I'll face down Birinar and my mother and set things right, but for now I'm happy to help you on your quest.~
@900 = ~And you're proving a valuable asset.~
@901 = ~You'll help for as long as I think you're useful, mage.~
@902 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@903 = ~(sigh) If I had a silver for every time I heard that line...~
@904 = ~Dealing with rogues, mercenaries, sorcerers and Waukeen knows what else... Imoen must really be a special person for you to go through all this trouble.~ [FWKLSYA8]
@905 = ~She is, indeed, although I would do the same for any of my trusted companions in need.~
@906 = ~I've known Imoen a long time and we've been through so much together, I can't abandon her now.~
@907 = ~Actually, she's a bit of a punk but I seem to have an overdeveloped sense of duty.~
@908 = ~Imoen? This is hardly about her. I want to find out who this Irenicus character thinks he is.~
@909 = ~I am not interested in discussing my motivations with you.~
@910 = ~I hope she appreciates what a good friend she has in you, then.~
@911 = ~I've tried to stay as far away from even thinking about the Cowled Wizards as possible, but I will say that what I have heard about their abduction squads isn't very encouraging.~
@912 = ~If you don't mind my saying so, for Imoen's sake we might want to get to the bottom of things as fast as possible.~
@913 = ~Believe me, that's my plan.~
@914 = ~You are here to cast spells, not offer strategic counsel, Kelsey. Keep it to yourself.~
@915 = ~I plan to, but I also need to be sure we are equipped to fight off any resistance, both on our way in and back out again.~
@916 = ~Imoen is tougher than she looks. I am sure she will hold out until the <CHARNAME> Cavalry arrives.~
@917 = ~If she doesn't last, perhaps Irenicus will still provide a measure of... satisfaction.~
@918 = ~Then lead on, <CHARNAME>!~
@919 = ~Sorry, you're right. I'm just worried about your friend. I will try to stick to what I know instead.~
@920 = ~I understand. I imagine Imoen wouldn't want you hurt trying to rescue her.~
@921 = ~I certainly hope so. I'd like to meet her, and I hope she is still herself when I do.~
@922 = ~Ah, the mysterious wizard. The way he tore effortlessly through the opposition, I suspect the man may be a sorcerer. I couldn't believe it when I heard that he stood down and allowed himself to be taken.~
@923 = ~If he makes the same mistake with me, his life will be forfeit.~
@924 = ~Perhaps he burned himself out with the effort. No matter. He knows secrets and I will have them.~
@925 = ~I was surprised myself, but it hardly makes me more sympathetic to my tormentor.~
@926 = ~If you're cowed by his power, there's no reason for you to stay in my company.~
@927 = ~Don't get overconfident. Powerful wizards have a lot of weapons at their disposal, and I'm sure-oh, never mind, I'm sure you know all this already. Pardon the interruption, <CHARNAME>.~
@928 = ~I hope you find what you seek, both your friend and your answers.~
@929 = ~I can certainly understand. I hope your next meeting with him is as unpleasant for him as your last meetings have been for you and Imoen.~
@930 = ~Cowed? No. Apprehensive? A little. But it won't affect my resolve to help you, I assure you.~
@931 = ~Really? I guess I couldn't pick up all the nuances of her personality from where I was standing.~
@932 = ~My loss, I guess.~
@933 = ~Forgive me for prying, Cernd, but you're a lycanthrope--a werewolf--by choice?~ [FWKLSY96]
@934 = ~What would make you want to become something people fear?~
@935 = ~But isn't it more than a little disturbing knowing that there's always a wolf inside of you, so to speak?~
@936 = ~Ah. While we're talking, what does nature have to say on the subject of sorcery? Does a walking pool of magical energy offend the balance or something like that?~
@937 = ~I hadn't looked at it that way.~
@938 = ~Oh, all things considered, please try never to wake me for guard duty in wolf-form.~
@939 = ~Viconia, is there any reason you've been staring at me for the past fifteen minutes?~ [FWKLSY97]
@940 = ~...or?~
@941 = ~Viconia, have you ever been told that you're a creep?~
@942 = ~Yep. Creep. Normally I don't think of women as "creeps", but unless I want to say something I think we'll both regret later, I'm sticking with it.~
@943 = ~Fair halfling, I cannot tell you how happy it makes me to see you sharpen your sword.~ [FWKLSY99]
@944 = ~Something like that. This isn't exactly the first time I've put myself in harm's way, but somehow the stakes feel just a bit higher around <CHARNAME>.~
@945 = ~What was Patrick like?~
@946 = ~I am sorry I will never get to meet him, and I am sorry for clumsily bringing up such a painful subject.~
@947 = ~Hey, Edwin, next time you work out a great plan to take over the world, you might want to make sure you don't give it all away while you're asleep.~ [FWKLSYA0]
@948 = ~It started a few nights ago. At first I thought you were under attack or in pain, then I just figured it was a dream. But no. Night after night, I'm hearing what are definitely details of some sort of master plan of conquest and subjugation, babbled quite audibly as the rest of us try to sleep.~
@949 = ~Siege warfare isn't my field, so you lost me when you were levitating the elephants over the castle walls. On a scale between hopeless and brilliant, though, I'd say on the whole you were laughably deluded. Try to put a cork in it while the rest of us are sleeping, will you?~
@950 = ~And you might want to cut down on the snide comments during waking hours as well. Before you get any big ideas, keep in mind that for all you know, Edwin, I could be a natural master of spell turning.~
@951 = ~So, Jaheira, you've been in this group a long time, right?~ [FWKLSYA4]
@952 = ~There's quite a lot of wild stories about what happened at Baldur's Gate--about Sarevok, about <CHARNAME>...~
@953 = ~Of course not. But surely there's some thread of truth in there, and whatever it is, it was a very difficult time for <PRO_HIMHER>. I imagine it was very valuable to have an experienced friend at hand amidst all the chaos and soul-searching losing your father and avenging his death would involve.~
@954 = ~I suppose I'm just a little envious. When I started manifesting my magic, all I had on hand to guide me was a widowed, distracted mother, an opportunistic uncle, and a brother too young to understand or be of much help.~
@955 = ~Ah, but a little help never hurts.~
@956 = ~Attention, everyone! I propose that from this day forth, all young men and women coming of age in a confusing, hostile environment should be issued elven warrior priestesses, to serve as field general, wilderness guide, and outspoken advisor.~
@957 = ~Hear hear!~
@958 = ~I certainly could have done a lot worse than sticking by Jaheira, and I suggest you do the same.~
@959 = ~You left out "nosy interloper" and "resident grouch." You're welcome to this one.~
@960 = ~Be careful what you wish for, Kelsey. They're damnably hard to get refunds for once they've outlived their usefulness.~
@961 = ~Yes, mistress.~
@962 = ~Have you ever considered having a child, Jaheira?~ [FWKLSYA5]
@963 = ~No, nothing like that. I was just wondering if you and Khalid--oh, hell, I'm sorry, this is a stupid question...~
@964 = ~But it's too late now, I've asked it. Did you and Khalid ever have children, or talk about it?~
@965 = ~I was only curious. For whatever it is worth, I suspect you would make a very good parent.~
@966 = ~No! I just think... I think that it's important for a mother to be a strong-minded person, and to be able to stay strong after losing her husband.~
@967 = ~I think if my mother had been a little more like you, things would have gone better after my father's death.~
@968 = ~Look, I'm sorry I brought it up at all. It was supposed to be a compliment.~
@969 = ~I cannot believe you are even remotely interested in my story, Viconia.~ [FWKLSY98]
@970 = ~To make a long story short, my father died while I was still a teenager, my mother's brother poisoned her against me, took over the family business, and the two of them drove me off.~
@971 = ~Then I met you, so obviously I haven't hit bottom yet.~
@972 = ~No, I am out here trying to make a living and get away from their indifference.~
@973 = ~In my darker moments, I admit I have considered it.~
@974 = ~However, hearing the idea packaged as advice from a sadist, I am now firmly convinced it would be the wrong thing to do.~
@975 = ~The boredom of what?~ [FWKLSY95]
@976 = ~Sorry, did you say "count all those oats?"~
@977 = ~I am not buying this at all, you understand, but tell me more about this oat-counting I am supposed to be doing. Doesn't it make more sense to weigh oats, rather than count them?~
@978 = ~Okay. So I'm supposed to turn myself over to some higher authority, get trained in oat-counting, and spend four years counting little oat flakes?~
@979 = ~How about this, Jan? When the Grain Enforcers come for me, you simply tell them that I've done my yeoman oat-counting service under your tutelage. Surely, someone who goes way back with, uh, Plumpleuff will hold sway, right?~
@980 = ~Haer'Dalis... you are gaping in my direction. Is our bard tongue tied?~ [FWKLSYA7]
@981 = ~Fine, go right ahead.~
@982 = ~I don't follow you.~
@983 = ~And you do, is that it?~
@984 = ~Well, speaking as a kindred soul, then, wouldn't you say it would be nice to be normal, just for once?~
@985 = ~Should I take this to mean that you've revised your opinion of me as a... what did you mutter yesterday, a "talentless weakling"? I'm glad I'm moving up in the world, at least.~ [FWKLSYA1]
@986 = ~You would prefer I be a little more like you? Backstab and slither my way through the ranks of whatever thieves' guild or loan shark happens to need a magic missile this week?~
@987 = ~Whatever. I just don't think I'm cut from the same "homicidal maniac" cloth as you. I'm sorry if that means we can't be friends.~
@988 = ~What in the hells are you talking about, Korgan?~ [FWKLSYA3]
@989 = ~My father was a good, honest man, but aside from that I assure you he wasn't as remarkable as you're implying. There were no hellspawn servants at my conception.~
@990 = ~I don't have to listen to this, and I won't, for much longer.~
@991 = ~Whatever you say.~
@992 = ~Oh, it's nothing.~ [FWKLSYA6]
@993 = ~All right, I admit it, I'm a little nervous. I'm pretty sure I've never saved an entire civilization from destruction before.~
@994 = ~Yes, that had occurred to me as well.~
@995 = ~I think so.~
@996 = ~Gee. You make it sound so easy. I guess if you put it that way, Imoen, I would be a fool to worry, right?~
@997 = ~Really?~
@998 = ~Gee, Imoen, you're a real inspiration.~
@999 = ~What was that?~
@1000 = ~I already told, uh, the both of you that I don't know any good recipes for crackers. You'll just have to buy more at the next tavern and try not to roll on them in your sleep this time.~ [FWKLSY89]
@1001 = ~Oh. I'm afraid that Boo has pointed you wrong, Minsc, because I am really not sure myself.~
@1002 = ~I would tell you if I better understood it, Minsc, but the truth is that I simply don't. There are the stories about Mystra, of course, and how she shares her powers with wizards and warlocks, but I'm not a regular wizard.~
@1003 = ~My magic is simply... inside me. I can't figure out where it comes from or what makes it go away or return. I wish I knew.~
@1004 = ~Well, where does your battle cry come from?~
@1005 = ~Yes, yes, just like my magic comes from my fingertips. But where does it COME from? You don't have to do anything special, you just know how to do it, right? My magic is like that.~
@1006 = ~That's a relief.~
@1007 = ~Imoen, are you okay?~ [FWKLSYF5]
@1008 = ~No, but I know you've been through a lot, so I--~
@1009 = ~What in the hells are you talking about, Korgan?~
@1010 = ~My father was a good, honest man, but aside from that I assure you he wasn't as remarkable as you're implying. There were no hellspawn servants at my conception.~
@1011 = ~I don't have to listen to this, and I won't, for much longer.~
@1012 = ~Whatever you say.~
@1013 = ~It's "Kelsey", Jan. But, sure.~ [FWKLSYF4]
@1014 = ~"Kels"--never mind. What's the problem, Jan? I have not heard many complaints from <CHARNAME>, do you know something I don't?~
@1015 = ~Jan, enough! What is it you want me to do? Wave my hands around and dance and sing? That's a big waste of energy, and I do not exactly want to make myself a target, I get beat up enough already as it is!~
@1016 = ~I don't know what to say, except that getting a gift from you is both flattering and frightening at the same time.~
@1017 = ~I just wanted to say, I'm impressed at how far you are willing to go out of your way to help people.~ [FWKLSYB2]
@1018 = ~You are proving yourself heroic in the best sense of the word, and I think anyone would be honored to work for you.~
@1019 = ~Are you sure you know what you are doing? The way things are going, we are liable to make an infamous name for ourselves.~ [FWKLSYB3]
@1020 = ~Infamous? Is that like more than famous?~
@1021 = ~Good.~
@1022 = ~If you don't like it, there's the proverbial door.~
@1023 = ~Only a temporary situation, Kelsey. Relax.~
@1024 = ~Very funny, I think you know exactly what I mean, <CHARNAME>. Seriously, I don't think this reflects well on any of us.~
@1025 = ~Good? I don't think I agree, <CHARNAME>.~
@1026 = ~There's no need to be so abrupt. It was just an observation. I'm trying to help.~
@1027 = ~I am glad to hear it. Let me know if you're looking for any insight.~
@1028 = ~You really seem to have a cruel streak in you. Nobody says you have to be a saint, but what we are doing is simply wrong.~ [FWKLSYB4]
@1029 = ~I'm no saint, I'm a sinner. Deal with it.~
@1030 = ~Sissy.~
@1031 = ~Mistakes happen. Things will get better.~
@1032 = ~I don't think I can support this sinner for much longer at this rate.~
@1033 = ~I suppose petty name-calling is easy after all these evil acts...~
@1034 = ~I think I have heard that one before, but I guess I am still hopeful.~
@1035 = ~I thought you were worth helping, but I see now that you are just an overblown bully. I hope to never see you or the likes of you again.~ [FWKLSYB5]


// START OF BANTER AND ROMANCE CONFLICT

@1036 = ~Yes! No! Dynaheir was taken from us by cowards and fiends! Minsc and Boo shall not rest until our witch has been avenged, when there are no more criminal butts to plant vengeance upon!~
@1037 = ~Khalid... Khalid was... never mind, I shall not discuss this with you, outsider.~
@1038 = ~Well, finally the mewling mage says something worth hearing. Thank you for the compliment, now stop your chattering and get back in line, boy.~
@1039 = ~In either event, you are addressing your betters, and I would say it is well past time you admitted it.~
@1040 = ~You can stop crowding her. My lady has better things to do than listen to you mewl, I assure you.~
@1041 = ~I have done nothing but speak plainly and directly. I am a man of action, something you would know little about, cowering in the shadows with your faerie fire and potions.~
@1042 = ~You had best watch your tongue if you plan to challenge my faith, boy! I stand amongst the righteous of the Vigilant One! You would not be the first to regret doubting that!~
@1043 = ~This is not over.~
@1044 = ~Have you no respect? My lady and I struggle day by day to keep rabble such as yourself organized and engaged, and all you do in exchange is whine.~
@1045 = ~What's more, you constantly disgrace yourself trying to worm your way into my lady's heart with your pitiful, embellished tales of woe.~
@1046 = ~You come and go as you please, but know your place. It is NOT by her side.~
@1047 = ~Because I respect the lady, unlike you who seek only to abuse her good graces, I will restrain myself from thrashing you publicly for your ongoing insolence. But I will not forget.~
@1048 = ~I have made a decision. It is time you were on your way, boy.~
@1049 = ~Yes, you! You are a burden on the road and untrustworthy in battle. And I have watched the way you have shamefully forced your affections on <CHARNAME>. You are bad for morale, and we will see no more of you.~
@1050 = ~This is no joke. You are dismissed.~
@1051 = ~But, my lady... the way he looks at you... I cannot stand idly by and watch this! It demands retribution!~
@1052 = ~If I were some childish squire, I imagine I would be at your throat by now, challenging you to a duel in her name.~
@1053 = ~That... would be a mistake, and would prove nothing. Nonetheless, I beseech you, my lady, please tell me plain. Am I not the man in your heart of hearts, and this boy but the pretender?~
@1054 = ~Yes, my love. Kelsey may be a friend, but he is not half the man you are.~
@1055 = ~I wouldn't presume too much, Anomen, but no, Kelsey is not my lover nor will he ever be.~
@1056 = ~Hah! Anomen, give it a rest. I far prefer Kelsey's affections to yours.~
@1057 = ~If you must force a choice, then I choose Kelsey.~
@1058 = ~Actually, I would much rather you do that duel-to-the-death thing. It would be a real turn-on.~
@1059 = ~I... I understand, my lady. I shall gaze upon your fair skin only from afar then, and please you with my service, if I never may with my body.~
@1060 = ~Very well, Kelsey, prepare to defend yourself!~
@1061 = ~--Nay, this is a prideful thing, done for the wrong reasons. My lady...my lady, I will kill and die for you, but not for pride.~
@1062 = ~Kelsey may be wiser than I... I seem to have let emotions and desires cloud my judgement.~
@1063 = ~Let us attempt to put these scene behind us.~
@1064 = ~I fear that I allow my baser desires to overwhelm my conscience in your presence, <CHARNAME>. I must be free of this, for everyone's sake. Farewell, lady.~
@1065 = ~I should be at your throat even now, boy! I challenge you to a duel in <CHARNAME>'s name! You seem man enough to desire her, are you man enough to fight for her as well?~
@1066 = ~Unless, of course, my lady wishes to speak it plain and save the bloodletting for more worthy foes. Tell him, <CHARNAME>, that I am the man in your heart of hearts, and he is but the pretender.~
@1067 = ~Kelsey, prepare to defend yourself!~
@1068 = ~Anomen, this is insane. Whoever she prefers, having one of us dead is not going to make her any happier!~
@1069 = ~Then, truly, nothing is settled. But this uncertainty burns worse than dragon fire. Please, my lady, end my torment and speak your heart so that we may break this impasse of emotion.~
@1070 = ~Kelsey may be a friend, but he is not half the man you are.~
@1071 = ~I challenge you to a duel in <CHARNAME>'s name! If your poisoned blood recognizes a god, I suggest you pray for intervention, Kelsey!~
@1072 = ~It would settle everything, by showing you who the better man truly is! But, if you would rather send Kelsey away unharmed, then I will certainly defer to you, my lady.~
@1073 = ~Kelsey, Anomen is right, I am not interested in you the way you might think.~
@1074 = ~Hah! Just watch me settle it, <CHARNAME>!~
@1075 = ~I--I cannot believe that maniac tried to kill me! I wish you would have tried a little harder to discourage him, I certainly didn't want this to happen.~
@1076 = ~I will be all right. I would like to get away from here, however...~
@1077 = ~There lies Kelsey! If he had just shown a little respect or asked for last rites, I might not have had to end his pitiful little life.~
@1078 = ~<CHARNAME>, I hope you see how much you mean to me. I will not let anyone get in the way of my passion for you.~
@1079 = ~Test.~

// MORE KELSEY NPC INTERACTION

@1200 = ~What? What are you talking about, young man?~
@1201 = ~By Torm, is that what you think? If I couldn't tell by the look in your eyes that you were serious, I would accuse you of vicious slander.~
@1202 = ~Kelsey, believe me when I say that I have called a number of mages "friend" in the past and am well willing to say the same about you.~
@1203 = ~So long as you are in <CHARNAME>'s company and <PRO_HESHE> works towards the path of right, I would not dream of looking at you as anything other than a trustworthy companion.~
@1204 = ~If only I could have. No, it is true enough that I have seen many battles against foes both mundane and arcane. And it is true enough that above and beyond devoting myself to bring justice and right, I have honed my skills and called upon Torm to help me neutralize the powers of wizards.~
@1205 = ~Kelsey, I see that you are a good person, but you are also not an innocent. You should realize, perhaps better than even I, that an unseen mage may cause greater chaos and destruction than a company of orcs or giants.~
@1206 = ~I am sure you can appreciate the need for those who can defend the helpless against such evil, those outside the cabal of wizardry who will be unswayed by notions of brotherhood in the arcane. Those sworn to die, if necessary, to ensure that an evil mage cannot dominate the minds and lives of men.~
@1207 = ~Apology accepted, my friend.~
@1208 = ~I don't think you and I have anything to discuss.~
@1209 = ~Let me put this another way-there's nothing I want to discuss with YOU.~
@1210 = ~(sigh) Fine.~
@1211 = ~Kelsey.~
@1212 = ~I can't answer your questions. If you want to know if I think you're like them, then no, you're not.~
@1213 = ~Do I think you could become like them? Yes. Probably even easier than you think. Magic corrupts, plain and simple, and from my experience, the easier it comes, the easier it corrupts.~
@1214 = ~Don't worry, Kelsey. I've been watching you since the day we met.~
@1215 = ~Har! Boy, ye just signed yer death warrant. Sir Sulky over there would cleave a mage fer spittin' on the sidewalk, and ye're handing him yer head on a platter! Dinna come cryin' ta me when ye're wearin' his blade!~
@1216 = ~Oh--oh, Valygar, whatever you do, please promise me you won't hurt him. I'm sure Kelsey's a good person... he wouldn't hurt us!~
@1217 = ~I didn't mean I was ready to kill you, Kelsey. I know, now, that not all mages are destined to become monsters.~
@1218 = ~You brought it up.~
@1219 = ~Minsc and Boo are often the first at a lot of things.~
@1220 = ~We do not let outward appearance stand in the way. Believe you me, Minsc and Boo are as familiar to each other as a tankard is with mead, as trees are with leaves, and as evil is with a sore backside! Right, Boo?~
@1221 = ~Why? What do you need with my spellbook? I thought it wouldn't do you any good.~  [FWNALI01]
@1222 = ~Hah! True enough. Ok, Kelsey, here you go.~
@1223 = ~What doesn't make sense?~
@1224 = ~Why does that bother you? Kelsey, I think you complain too much. Personally, I wish magic came as easily to me as it seems to for you. I don't even want to think about how many hours I've spent studying spells.~
@1225 = ~Doing good deeds and making something of your life isn't easy-believe me, I know, I've had to fight my family and my "peers" all the way. All of us have to work at it. I doubt that part would come any easier to the "real" mages you keep comparing yourself to.~
@1226 = ~Uh, I'll think about it. Don't push your luck, sorcerer.~
@1227 = ~Okay. Thanks, I guess.~ [FWNALI02]
@1228 = ~Well, even though I thought it a terrible waste of the tenants' hard-earned money, Aunty used to try to make sure I was stocked with whatever cream or lotion she had just had imported from Calimshan before I went out on my excursions, but I've long since run out.~
@1229 = ~Okay, good.~
@1230 = ~Excuse me?~
@1231 = ~Er...~
@1232 = ~Oh, please, Kelsey. For starters, I'm perfectly capable of buying or not buying whatever I want to put or not put on my face and hands!~
@1233 = ~For another, mind your own business, already! You're a nice guy, but this attention is really too much.~
@1234 = ~It's CERTAINLY not Isaea and... no, it's nothing like the other, either! There's no time for dalliances when there are so many in need and so much to do! I'm just... I'm focusing on <CHARNAME>'s problems while I'm with <PRO_HIMHER> and I think you should do the same.~
@1235 = ~I-what?~
@1236 = ~Oh, it's not really as complicated as you make it sound, Kelsey. I just try to anticipate what <CHARNAME> expects of me, and I prepare accordingly.~
@1237 = ~Well, sure, it can be exhausting, but since Quayle set me free and taught me so much, I want to help people, not just sit around doing nothing. It's really not as hard as you make it sound.~
@1238 = ~Oh. W-well, thank you, Kelsey.~
@1239 = ~Well, I'm glad you decided to look past the slander and come to the source! People can be so cruel with their words. Not to mention their floral arrangements. In the tragic Botanical Campaigns of '32, Auntie Clematis and her Climbing Rose Stormtroopers cut a swath of destruction that left buildings burning, motherless children crying, and several legion generals unemployed and baffled before she could be stopped... by the frost, you see. It didn't kill the blood-thirsty plant beasts, but they wouldn't take her seriously with icicles hanging from her nose, so the whole plan sort of fell apart.~
@1240 = ~Ah yes. Well, there was Cousin Barium, but he's more of a footnote really. He claimed to specialize in "area effect" spells, such as Stinking Cloud, Cloud Kill and Death Fog, but recent research brings to light that his apparently limitless magical powers may have actually been connected entirely to undercooked turnips and an excess of stomach acid.~
@1241 = ~Then there's Froggo, who was once a ward of Golodon the Unmanned. Sadly, I suppose Froggo doesn't count either, because when he discovered he couldn't keep track of the simplest turnip-harvesting cantrips, he suddenly declared that he was henceforth a sorcerer and would weave magic out of thin air, without memorization. Of course, Froggo had neither the memory to become a mage nor the inbred talent to be a sorcerer, so through a bizarre twist of fate involving a cracked crystal ball and a handful of melted soap, Froggo put his talents to their best possible use, and is now the Chief Improvisational Comic in a small village in the land of Greyhawk.~
@1242 = ~That's all right. I swore off helping sorcerers after enduring Barium's last Cloud Kill.~
@1243 = ~When I...? Why does everyone insist on treating me like a child? I may not have my wings but I am much older than you and I am as "grown up" as I will ever be!~
@1244 = ~Oh, Kelsey, you don't understand! Nobody does! The wide-open world isn't new to me, I had it and now it's gone! It's been taken from me, forever! *sniff*~
@1245 = ~What is this? Who is bringing despair and woe to our witch? Boo says he will tear into the eyes of naughty boys who make little girls cry! Boo is very sensitive about these things. He tells me he is empathic, although I believe he is just nice.~
@1246 = ~I... I know you didn't mean to hurt, Kelsey.~
@1247 = ~But I suppose I don't know what to do. Uncle Quayle thought <CHARNAME> could keep me safe while I saw the world, but I can't say I much want to be like most of the people I have met since leaving the circus.~
@1248 = ~But I suppose I don't know what to do. Uncle Quayle... *sniff*... Quayle told me he wanted me to see the world some day, but I can't say I much want to be like most of the people I have met since leaving the circus.~
@1249 = ~Uncle Quayle taught me to help other people and help myself, so perhaps I would enjoy being a healer. I don't like all this fighting, but if I had to say I have a favorite part, it would be healing everyone after.~
@1250 = ~Ah, my sweet dove, always seeking to fit the pieces back together. You would stand against the tides with protective arms swept wide 'ere the shoreline to complain of the cold and the damp.~
@1251 = ~Perhaps some day I will be able to travel with both my Uncle Quayle and <CHARNAME>, but Quayle seems happier living a quiet life.~
@1252 = ~I...I would have liked to travel with both my Uncle Quayle and <CHARNAME>... but that's just not possible now, is it?~
@1253 = ~And what do you want to do when YOU grow up, Kelsey?~
@1254 = ~Sure, it's a deal.~
@1255 = ~A promising beginning to any conversation. Do you begin all of your sales pitches in this manner?~
@1256 = ~Ohoh! What is this? Free career counseling from the strangest places!~
@1257 = ~I am not, friend Kelsey, a garden variety cutpurse by vocation. I pride myself--I stake my honor--on finding that which is lost. Having found it, I appropriate it, and place it where it is most wanted.~
@1258 = ~And of course, those who turn to Yoshimo are clearly the ones who want it the most!~
@1259 = ~Ehhh, you confuse the issue, Kelsey. You see only the pilfered candles and the lightened purse and think it is all mean-spirited.~
@1260 = ~Why, I could find a kidnapped delicate maiden, stealthily subvert and subdue her captors and snatch her from the jaws of certain debauchery!~
@1261 = ~You learn quickly!~
@1262 = ~And what good is a beautiful bauble in a smoky glass case at the back of some private collection? Are we not all better off from a public showing?~
@1263 = ~And if that is impossible, should we not at least... circulate the wealth a little, rather than let it sit locked in the case?~
@1264 = ~Oh? And what if our delicate maiden was bought and paid for? You believe that whenever coin passes knowledgeably it is a good thing, and whenever it is unwitting it is bad? You have much to learn, Kelsey.~
@1265 = ~Ahhhh, Kelsey. Tell me when you tire of being so correct. I will carry that heavy burden for you.~
@1266 = ~Then keep yer scrawny hands off it!~
@1267 = ~Give it here, blast ye!~
@1268 = ~(sigh) I warned ye to keep yer hands off it, bowelhive. I've killed to protect smaller secrets.~
@1269 = ~Aye, sentimental of the night I spent being pleasured endlessly by yer beggin' sister afore I shoved her into the gutter! Now fer the last time, ye pasty git, hand over the volume or I lop off yer wrists and take it from ye!~
@1270 = ~If that is a question, then the answer is yes.~
@1271 = ~To a druid, taking on another one of nature's forms is a right and a privilege. As her servant, I realized that the wolf is perfect for such a role.~
@1272 = ~The wolf is beautiful at rest and in motion, yet always commands respect. A dog may be tricked, a bear may slumber deeply while an intruder ravages the forest around him, but the wolf can never be taken lightly.~
@1273 = ~No more disturbing than knowing as the wolf that there is always a human inside of me.~
@1274 = ~Not at all. Innate understanding is one of nature's greatest gifts. The blade of grass need not study to know that it should grow towards the sun, nor do the salmon consult wise men before swimming upstream. Perhaps you are a living embodiment of nature's willingness to finally embrace the arcane.~
@1275 = ~All things have their place in the balance, Kelsey, but I will do my best to ensure that when I rouse you, my face has a nose, not a snout.~
@1276 = ~For starters, impudent jaluk, I will look where I will, and I dare you to stop me. And do not flatter yourself to think you were inspiring any delicious daydreams, iblith. Since mages do not wear short swords, I know perfectly well where your mind has strayed.~
@1277 = ~I was in fact pondering a very singular question. I am wondering, had you been born Drow, if your considerable and unusual magical talents would have elevated you to a position of power and terror, or...~
@1278 = ~...or landed your brain in a cozy little jar in some high priestess's curio closet, awaiting dissection and detailed study so that Kelseys by the thousands could be bred and unleashed upon her rivals.~
@1279 = ~In either event, a truly inspiring outcome for one as otherwise pitiful and hopeless as yourself, no?~
@1280 = ~Personally, I believe it would be the flip of a coin whether you lived or died once your powers manifested themselves, largely dependent on the mood of the Matron Mother when the situation was explained to her.~
@1281 = ~My money would be on sparing your life, at least for some time. Males waste so much time trying to master the arts, certainly our hypothetical Matron Mother would not throw away such an advantage blindly.~
@1282 = ~There is, of course, the matter of your rather disappointing pigeon chest that I fear might tend to ruin your chances for real advancement in Drow society. But then, some prefer their males a little...less threatening.~
@1283 = ~Having concerns about your mortality, my friend?~
@1284 = ~Indeed, our leader has attracted the attention of some powerful adversaries, but if I may humbly say so, <PRO_HESHE> has shown at least an equal knack for recruiting allies up to the challenge, present company included.~
@1285 = ~Doubt is... not something I am accustomed to admitting to, but I do sometimes wish I had the same aptitude as <CHARNAME>. My company... and my Patrick... might still be alive today.~
@1286 = ~You mean, before he was taken by the Shade Lord? Patrick was a delight. He was a noble woodsman despite his height, and dedicated to helping those in need, even if they were too proud to acknowledge help from little folk.~
@1287 = ~He also studied the theater. He never performed on stage, but even the most childish puppet show drew him like a magnet. Sometimes, at night or during one of our interminable marches, he would suddenly break into a great dramatic monologue, or just recite a few lines of poetry.~
@1288 = ~Patrick never admitted to it, but I do believe he wrote many of them himself. And now he is gone. May his soul forever rest.~
@1289 = ~There is nothing to apologize for, Kelsey. I thank you for helping me keep my memory of Patrick strong and vivid.~
@1290 = ~What are you prattling about, mageling boy?~
@1291 = ~You are obviously imagining things; undoubtedly your freakish poisoned blood is choking off your brain. (But perhaps my subconscious is worth listening to...) Ehhhh...what did you think of the plan?~
@1292 = ~(This one, I will keep his ashes after I have disintegrated his body to dust.)~
@1293 = ~Some days, it seems like forever, but yes, I have been travelling in our leader's company for many months now.~
@1294 = ~Indeed. I certainly hope you are not so foolish as to believe everything you hear.~
@1295 = ~Yes, well, I think we have both grown to value each other's company and advice through some... difficult times. Why this interest, Kelsey?~
@1296 = ~<CHARNAME> keeps <PRO_HISHER> own counsel, but <PRO_HESHE> knows I am always willing to offer my guidance. Why are we having this conversation, Kelsey?~
@1297 = ~Even in the company of others, most of life's difficult lessons are learned alone. Deal with it, or go back to your counting-house, Kelsey.~
@1298 = ~Thank you.~
@1299 = ~Very funny.~
@1300 = ~As for you, Kelsey-if you want advice, ask me a question. But spare me the tragic poetry of your troubled childhood.~
@1301 = ~We are what we make of our situation. Do not let wishing for a better yesterday distract you from doing something worthwhile today, or you will quickly become a burden. Understood?~
@1302 = ~I sincerely hope, for your sake, that this is not your idea of a proposition.~
@1303 = ~I agree.~
@1304 = ~No, not as such. We agreed that our work together, with the Harpers, was more important. Besides, I look after enough of Nature's children without having to worry about my own.~
@1305 = ~Are you taking a poll, or just being generally intrusive?~
@1306 = ~Now I am almost sure this is a proposition. I have no patience for juvenile games.~
@1307 = ~You are treading carelessly into the realm of both the sensitive and the maudlin, Kelsey.~
@1308 = ~Mageling, take it from one who knows--you are far from home, and out of place. Why do you not go back to your own people, jaluk?~
@1309 = ~On the contrary, it pleases me to hear about the petty squabbles of rivvil.~
@1310 = ~I see. How terrible for you.~
@1311 = ~I presume you are out here trying to prove yourself a man or some such puffery?~
@1312 = ~If they have wounded you so, why not simply kill them both and be done with it?~
@1313 = ~I will not even waste the Drow language on you. You are a pathetic weakling, Kelsey.~
@1314 = ~So, Kelsey. Tell me how you dealt with the boredom.~
@1315 = ~You know, the boredom of having to count all those oats.~
@1316 = ~I only assumed that since oat counting is such an important part of most sorcerer's lives that you would have done your obligatory three and a half years of service in Semphar or the Shining Plains, where I am made to understand most young sorcerers choose to do their tour of oat-counting duty.~
@1317 = ~Oh, I agree with you one hundred and thirty-leven percent, but the oat-counting edict from the College of Granary Mages holds sway in most civilized lands. A portion of every farmer's crop must be both weighed AND counted by certified oat-counting sorcerers.~
@1318 = ~It all got started with Plumpleuff, my childhood boon companion. We all knew Plumpleuff would amount to something, and he really flourished when he became a High Priest of Bane. Well, one morning Plumpy cast Speak With Grains, one of his special Bane-given powers, on his breakfast and learned that oat farmers were constantly short-loading the honest breakfasty vendors throughout the known world. Plumpleuff could never keep a secret, especially not an agricultural one, so word got out and the College imposed a draft to help right the balance.~
@1319 = ~You wouldn't think Bane would have such an interest in cereals, but it turns out he's really a fiend for a good hot bladder full of oatmeal. Anyway, as Bane's loyal servant, Plumpleuff could not let this affront to everything Bane held dear continue, so he contacted his friends in the College and they raised quite a stink over the matter. Bane considered smiting the whole lot of them for reckless endangerment but a compromise was struck, and that's where you, oat-counter to be, come in.~
@1320 = ~Plumpy was such a nice chap. Too bad about that accident with the sugar-coated thresher.~
@1321 = ~No, I'm afraid that if the College of Granary Mages gets their hands on you now, things will be a lot worse. A special Polymorph Other will turn you into a REAL oat-counter...I'm afraid there's 42 months of service as an abacus in your future. I saw it happen to Cousin Barium when they came to him. He was never quite the same after.~
@1322 = ~Oh... what the heck, I like the look of your elbows. I'll do it, for a turnip.~
@1323 = ~Only after a fashion. This sparrow is formulating a question for you, if you will hear it.~
@1324 = ~Alas, I must admit, I am quite the eavesdropper. Several times now, I have overheard you speak ill of your unique gift. What is it that makes you so unhappy?~
@1325 = ~One cannot escape the impression you think you have "bad blood." In this sparrow's opinion, you simply have no idea what you are talking about.~
@1326 = ~Why, yes! Open your eyes, man! My heart pumps the blood of demons! I stand alone, or as near to it as matters, in this plane. As for you... your kind is not so unusual, in my experience.~
@1327 = ~Nay. To be normal is to be boring, to be an insignificant speck on the multiverse. For our souls to truly be free, we must embrace that which makes us different.~
@1328 = ~So, how does it feel to know that you are perhaps the single biggest waste of innate magical talent in Amn?~
@1329 = ~I see you as a cripple. Like one born without sight or hearing, you were born without the capacity for ambition. (although his monkey face alone is a handicap...)~
@1330 = ~You hide behind meager witticisms because they are the only weapon you are courageous enough to wield.~
@1331 = ~I swear, I'd rather be a gully dwarf than some kind of demon freak. Sure ye don't want me to end yer misery afore ye sprout horns and a tail?~
@1332 = ~You, ye weak-kneed spellcasting sissy! Oh, ye may look like an average gangly softheaded above-grounder, but I knows a thing or two about yer sorcerin' kind.~
@1333 = ~I knows yer mam slept with a three-toed devil or sold her soiled underthings to a pack of wandering imps in exchange fer your sorry half-breed hide! Everyone knows sorcerers get their power from the worlds beyond.~
@1334 = ~A genealogy lesson from one so vile it seems impossible that he even had a mother? This should be worth hearing.~
@1335 = ~Oh? Were ye there, bowelhive? I says I know what ye are and damn ye to try to convince me otherwise.~
@1336 = ~Aye, that's it, a threat from the pansy! Yer devilish kin nor yer pretty colored spells will nay save ye if I get one good swing o' me axe flying in yer direction, so I'd watch the tongue.~
@1337 = ~That's right, whatever I say goes around here. And I say if I sees any hints of scales or horns or a forked tongue as yer demon blood begins to show, me axe will strike home afore ye have time to pray for yer soul.~
@1338 = ~Pay the angry soldier no mind, Kelsey. Even I may not fully understand your talents, but I will ensure none spills your blood over them.~
@1339 = ~Hey, Kelsey, what's the matter? You look kinda nervous.~
@1340 = ~Ok, Mr. Bigshot, you keep telling yourself that.~
@1341 = ~And you're worried about the bazillion bad guys we still have to fight, right?~
@1342 = ~That's it?~
@1343 = ~Okay, good. Now you can relax. Saving the world is no big thing. Heck, we're practically making a habit out of it.~
@1344 = ~I mean, you know how this stuff works. When the bad guys show up, listen to <CHARNAME> and do whatever <PRO_HESHE> tells you to do.~
@1345 = ~Unless it's really dumb, in which case you just do whatever seems to make more sense. A few minutes later, and poof! Dead bad guys. I've seen it hundreds of times.~
@1346 = ~Right! Besides, I'll be fighting here with you. I promise that if you get in trouble I'll cast my most powerful spell at whoever is giving you a hard time, or I'll sneak up behind them and give them a skull-whomping whack they'll never forget.~
@1347 = ~Um, yeah! Unless I decide I'd rather go home and take a bath and bake a cake or something.~
@1348 = ~So I probably promise.~
@1349 = ~Thanks, Kelsey! Ya big sissy.~
@1350 = ~Um, I said "Hope they miss me!"~
@1351 = ~Kelsey, I have a question, and Boo is agreeing that you are a good person to answer.~
@1352 = ~Ah, no, that is not the question this time. I have been wondering for some time where magic comes from. Boo, to my surprise, is not sure.~
@1353 = ~But, you wear those robes and both Boo and I are firmly convinced that we have seen magic shoot from your fingertips and eyeballs and navel on a number of occasions!~
@1354 = ~Boo will be very disappointed to know that behind your innocent face is a stingy villain who will not answer a simple question from a friend!~
@1355 = ~Minsc thinks that is a very serious problem, to have all of that power but not know what it looks like!~
@1356 = ~Why, it comes from the belly and the lungs and the throat! BUTT KICKING--~
@1357 = ~This is a good comparison. Boo suspects you may still be dodging the question, but I will do my best to explain things to him.~
@1358 = ~Yep. Just tripped over something that wasn't actually there. No biggie. You don't think I'm falling to pieces already, do you?~
@1359 = ~Good. Me and <CHARNAME> can get through anything together. See, I can't fall to pieces, or else <PRO_HESHE> won't have anyone around to keep <PRO_HIMHER> in line.~
@1360 = ~Geez, guys, let's not bury Imoen before she's dead, do you mind?~
@1361 = ~Kelly, can you spare a moment of your time for a chat? Trader-mage to slightly shorter but more handsome trader-mage?~
@1362 = ~Well, Carrie, I must say you're proving quite a disappointment to me in combat.~
@1363 = ~<CHARNAME> only looks at the body count, Katie, and there you've done enough to make even the bloodthirstiest Jansen of all time, Oswald Ernest Frindo "The Carrot Flayer" Jansen proud. Oswald didn't get that name because he flayed carrots. No, Ozzie flayed his enemies WITH carrots. Quite an ingenious process, especially when you appreciate that he sharpened the carrots on his victim's toenails. Ozzie was, of course, a bit of a disappointment to the family. The official record of his disownership says it was over the carnage, but between you, me, and the cracker barrel, no Jansen worth his short and curlies should brutally flay his victims with anything but a turnip. Not that I've tried, often, of course.~
@1364 = ~No, no, Calista, I'm not talking about substance. The end result is such a minor part of the dedicated wizard's work. I'm talking about style, kiddo. And there, well, let's just say you've demonstrated less knack and flair in your spellcasting than my adopted cousin Plesival, and we're all pretty sure Plessy wasn't actually casting Sleep, he just won a lot of staring contests. Especially with the ravens he kept in the stewpots he used to line the barrow he took over from...~
@1365 = ~I thought you would resist, Chelsea, but I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. In my spare time I made, especially for you, a Jansen Sorcerer Visual Enhancement Sphere. It's just the prototype, but it's absolutely guaranteed to make you a spellcaster that dazzles and frazzles and basically scares the nightlights out of anyone who crosses your path. Except, of course, the blind, but there's no reason you should treat them any different. Just tell them that they would be scared if they could see you. Combat psychology is a wonderful field of study, and Auntie Clematis was the best teacher in all of Faerun...or at least, on my block.~
@1366 = ~Oh, there's nothing to fear, Kristen. Jansen AdventureWear products are almost always reliable, and safety is rarely a concern. I think I can count the number of fatal accidents on two hands, easily.~

@1390 = ~(sigh)~
@1391 = ~Smarter than ye look, boy. Ye may live to grow a beard yet. But if word of this gets out, they'll be servin' sorcerer sausages out of yer entrails at the Copper Coronet for the next tenday.~

@1400 = ~I regret nothing, and you would do well to remember that, lest you find that short sword reduced to a dart as you sleep.~
@1401 = ~So, Trader Kelsey, when the day is done and the boots are off, what do you enjoy more? Games of skill, or games of chance?~
@1402 = ~You mean, would I rather lose money to you in a classy way, playing chess, or like a real man, dicing?~ [FWKLSYG0]
@1403 = ~I am wounded by this ongoing antagonism, as though we are some sort of natural enemies.~
@1404 = ~But we ARE natural enemies, Yoshimo.~
@1405 = ~You also wound me in mistaking me for a common footpad... and I have no doubt that you would certainly wound any common footpad who assumed you were his natural prey.~
@1406 = ~I'm glad we're clear.~
@1407 = ~Clear on everything except what type of man you truly are, Kelsey. One type prefers to live by his wits, the other by fortune, and I cannot as yet tell which type you are.~
@1408 = ~I think the only game I'm willing to play for any kind of stakes with you is "Heads, I Win--Tails, You Lose."~
@1409 = ~Ah. You are that third type, then, who wishes to play by his own rules or none at all.~
@1410 = ~I can't help it. With some opponents, I think the only winning move is not to play.~

@1411 = ~Mazzy, how does a knight know when she is done?~ [FWKLSYG1]
@1412 = ~"Done?" As in "done for?"~
@1413 = ~No, I mean, as in completed, finished. A guard knows when he is done when he goes off-shift, a shopkeeper knows he is done when he closes the store.~
@1414 = ~But nobody ever comes along to spell a travelling knight, do they? So how can you ever stop working until you kill yourself with exertion?~
@1415 = ~Surely, you are teasing me.~
@1416 = ~No, I'm being serious. Even a knight of some army or church order has assignment, has leave. I know what you do is important, but how do you pace yourself, with no one to tell you when it's quitting time?~
@1417 = ~I do not wish to think you are making light of my calling, Kelsey. This is not a whim or a pastime or piece-work. I wield a sword of right in Arvoreen's name. That the responsibilities do not include a set schedule does not concern me nearly as much as you, it seems.~
@1418 = ~Yet, you are right, it never does seem to end, nor do I see how it could. Strive though we do for right, it is a cold, harsh thing to know that I am not likely to outlive evil.~
@1419 = ~I know that I cannot right every wrong, be everywhere at once. But I have been blessed with a strong enough body to do what good I can, and I trust that body will carry me to do the service I know I must.~
@1420 = ~And you'll have time to rest when you are dead?~
@1421 = ~Perhaps I would not put it so bluntly, but aye, I do believe, gods willing, that the work I do will not be forgotten when I die or am slain.~
@1422 = ~Since you are so worried, I might also rest better in this life if you did not feel it beneath you to acquire a few extra pillows for our hard-earned coin at the next inn!~
@1423 = ~I did not know I was not meeting your expectations as a negotiator, Mazzy. I will see what I can do.~
@1424 = ~I apologize, Kelsey. I certainly did not mean to snap--~
@1425 = ~Forget it, Mazzy. Like I said, I will see what I can do.~


// FWKelseyInterject.d stuff @1500 - @1762

@1500 = ~Urk. Who was the lucky donor?~
@1501 = ~I see. Make him human. Worst fate there is. I doubt you even realize how insulting that is.~
@1502 = ~So, Irenicus is the elven kingdom's own home-town, born-and-bred kind of maniac.~
@1503 = ~I lost a loved one in a battle with his sister, Bodhi.  I seek a means of curing him.~
@1504 = ~There's a joke there, somewhere... he would give his entire kingdom for a heart. Somebody should write that down...~
@1505 = ~At this point, I doubt any of us could disagree.~
@1506 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't let the sad stories fool you, exactly, as every man and woman in this town would love to have their own powerful trade monopoly, but it sounds like these genies are playing extremely dirty.~
@1507 = ~Lord Logan is not overstating things, <CHARNAME>. For better or for worse, Trademeet is built for the easy flow of goods in and out of the city. A monopoly, especially one enforced by powerful creatures, would eventually kill the town and ruin countless lives.~
@1508 = ~<CHARNAME>, if Trademeet is in trouble, the region's entire economy could be at stake. Helping them would be a powerful statement, and probably lucrative as well.~
@1509 = ~Whatever the cause, if Trademeet is in bad enough trouble that they are looking for relief all the way in Athkatla, it means the region's entire economy could be at stake.~
@1510 = ~<CHARNAME>! This girl should not be forced to sell herself. I think we can do better than simply telling her that life is tough.~
@1511 = ~Wow. I guess Brynnlaw's total lack of barding colleges really shows.~
@1512 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry. I hope we are not too late to undo the damage they have done to her.~
@1513 = ~If it's really their money, let them blow it on booze, <CHARNAME>... hopefully they'll learn quickly enough that it's about the most profitless way to spend hard-earned coin.~
@1514 = ~I know it seems strange, <CHARNAME>, but if you think about it, almost any way of life worth living has its patron and its religion.~
@1515 = ~It's hard to argue with a salesman who convinces you that you'll die unless you buy his product. He wins either way. ~
@1516 = ~If we destroy the jailer, we may be able to save others from being imprisoned here so easily. Give it some thought, <CHARNAME>.~
@1517 = ~<CHARNAME>, if she has truly done nothing wrong, leave her be. You remember what happened to your Imoen.~
@1518 = ~So. Killing just to kill, and brutally. I doubt that even if they had coin it would save them from that sort of monster.~
@1519 = ~You, there! I do not like the look of your magic aura at all, male! What manner of deviant are you?~
@1520 = ~Well...~
@1521 = ~This one's magic is exactly as I wish it to be, male. If you are troubled by what you see, I shall have your eyes plucked out.~
@1522 = ~Ah, no! I am not troubled at all, honored female! I truly meant no offense to you or your House!~
@1523 = ~Then begone, lest we take your insults personally.~
@1524 = ~Yes, yes!~
@1525 = ~Thank you for your help, Viconia. I wasn't sure how to handle that.~
@1526 = ~Yes, yes, I know. Rather than watch you try and pitifully fail to verbally fence with a Drow, I thought I would save us all some embarrassment.~
@1527 = ~You are clearly paranoid, male. I see nothing wrong with my wizard. Go about your business.~
@1528 = ~Ah. As you command, honored female.~
@1529 = ~Whew! Thanks, Jaheira.~
@1530 = ~Pay attention, Kelsey! Try to be a little more assertive, will you? We must all do our parts in this masquerade if we are to survive this madness.~
@1531 = ~Yes, honored female.~
@1532 = ~He is under my protection. Do not concern yourself.~
@1533 = ~That could have been close... thank you, Mazzy.~
@1534 = ~It is strange and unnatural, the abject fear these men have of drow women, but we must take what advantage we have in this unholy place, I suppose.~
@1535 = ~My differences are not open for discussion.~
@1536 = ~Oh? What do you hide, worm?~
@1537 = ~I think you are imagining things. I will be on my way now.~
@1538 = ~I have my eye on you! The matrons will never let you take my place!~
@1539 = ~My, what colors. Is that what the nouveau riches wear these days? How charming.~
@1540 = ~Not that you care, but I dress for comfort, not to parade myself in front of the likes of you.~
@1541 = ~Hey, you! You look like magic! (hic) Make something appear for me!~
@1542 = ~Sorry, I don't do mixed drinks.~
@1543 = ~Why, if it isn't that sniveling sorcerer...Kelsey, wasn't it? Still trying to get the hang of Chromatic Orb, I imagine.~
@1544 = ~Don't talk to me. Just stand there and look tough or whatever it is you enjoy doing.~
@1545 = ~Ah, the sorcerer returns.~
@1546 = ~I...~
@1547 = ~Relax, I remember your face, and you are safe here. You purchased a scroll from me recently, did you not?~
@1548 = ~Yes, I did.~
@1549 = ~And?~
@1550 = ~...and, as usual, I stared at it for a while until I was sure I would never be able to scribe it or learn it in any meaningful way.~
@1551 = ~So then I cast it. When nobody was around, of course. Stupid wizard eye wanted to follow me around for hours, it seemed.~
@1552 = ~Sorcery is a gift even some talented wizards would love to have at their disposal.~
@1553 = ~And, of course, my library stands ready to stock you with any spells you are not...intimately familiar with.~
@1554 = ~Of course. We will return if we need anything. Good business to you, Lady Yuth.~
@1555 = ~And to you.~
@1556 = ~What can Vincenzo be doin' for you, then?~
@1557 = ~Ah, sir, about that book of yours...~
@1558 = ~Yeah? Gripping stuff, innit? And true, every word, Vincenzo is sure o' that!~
@1559 = ~Well, I did notice that there were a fair few copies in the back...you know, it might sell better if you didn't keep insisting that Umar is real...~
@1560 = ~And compromise me art? Sir, you insult me in me own bar!~
@1561 = ~You ARE an insult in yer own bar!~
@1562 = ~Shut it, you!~
@1563 = ~As for your little criticism, what exactly is an honest bloke supposed to do?~
@1564 = ~Dress it up a little. Embellish the story, perhaps change some of the names and characters, and just try to sell it as straight fiction. Some people like scary stories, after all.~
@1565 = ~Hmmm. I don't rightly know. Seems to me Umar might take it as an insult, like, if I were ta just write 'er out of history like that.~
@1566 = ~(sigh) Never mind, then.~
@1567 = ~Elhan! I've the half vampire body of Kelsey here because of you! You'll tell me now!~
@1568 = ~A loved one was taken by a vampire. What can I expect when I find them?~
@1569 = ~Someone I care about has fallen to a vampire. Is there any way to save them?~
@1570 = ~Oh, you again. I told you, if you insist on pressing that ridiculous matter you will have to do it through my secretary.~
@1571 = ~No, I have better things to do now than chase down your bad debts to my family. But if you put as much money in the hands of the people you owed as you do in your silks, we wouldn't have this problem.~
@1572 = ~Oh, do run along now.~
@1573 = ~You are troubled, both by gifts and by scorn you feel are undeserved. Embrace the former within, and learn to disregard the latter without, or be consumed by torment of your own making.~
@1574 = ~I imagine everybody should try to be more self-sufficient. I could have told you that for free.~
@1575 = ~And just how much is this 'monetary sacrifice', exactly?~
@1576 = ~This isn't going to be pretty, <CHARNAME>. The Cowled Wizards are basically a monopoly on magic, and monopolies keep prices high and quantities low...~
@1577 = ~Yow! That was worse than I thought. But if it means I can cast freely while we're in the city, perhaps it was worthwhile. I doubt we're totally free of their scrutiny, however.~
@1578 = ~Heh. I really enjoy when clerics with bad attitudes try to make me feel all warm and welcome. They're so bad at it!~
@1579 = ~Silence! Do you have need of Umberlee's services or not?~
@1580 = ~I do. What services have you available?~
@1581 = ~I do not have need of your services.~
@1582 = ~What can I do for you this day?~
@1583 = ~Why, it's Hes, isn't it?~
@1584 = ~Yes! It is Hes! And it is Kelsey! How are times finding you?~
@1585 = ~Things go well, Hes...business obligations are light, but I am travelling with <CHARNAME> now.~
@1586 = ~Indeed, and the travel seems to suit you. Since you have so much to do, you will be needing to equip well, yes?~
@1587 = ~Ah, well, it's <CHARNAME>'s loot to spend, Hes, but rest assured, I will be sure to mention your name when <PRO_HESHE> needs supplies.~
@1588 = ~Then this has been a good day for both of us!~
@1589 = ~`Allo! Step closer, so that you might see me wares better!~
@1590 = ~Is that you, Alic? Still in business, I see.~
@1591 = ~Yes, business still finds me in business, Kelsey, and I find business wherever I can.~
@1592 = ~I seem to remember that on my last trip, you were within the Promenade proper. Why the move?~
@1593 = ~Business is of course good in the Promenade, but it is so crowded, so many competing merchants ready to undercut you. And you have but one chance.~
@1594 = ~Here, by the tunnel, they have no choice but to see me! And I have a chance to get them coming and going, so to speak!~
@1595 = ~Good point, Alic. Good business to you.~
@1596 = ~And to you and your friends, who are of course welcome to peruse everything I have to offer.~
@1597 = ~Oh, of course.~
@1598 = ~Yes, I shall see what you have.~
@1599 = ~Psst! You do realize that we're not talking about supporting a few fences in Athkatla, that you're proposing to do trade with the Drow, here, right?~
@1600 = ~Ah, well, if you want to make a deal at knifepoint, we seem to be the gang to talk to these days...~
@1601 = ~Why, do you have the story available in book form? In my experience, anyone using the word "prithee" is usually selling something.~ [FWKLSYF6]
@1602 = ~Do you often answer to "my lady", Kelsey? Perhaps you should have your dainty ears checked, so you will know when you are not being addressed.~
@1603 = ~<CHARNAME>, please forgive the interruption. I stand ready to share. The gaps in your knowledge of my accomplishments are indeed extensive.~
@1604 = ~I am not interested in hearing of your travels, Anomen.~
@1605 = ~And that's exactly the way I like it.~
@1606 = ~Alright, then... tell me of your journeys, if you wish.~
@1607 = ~Sorry, Anomen, this is no time to speak.~
@1608 = ~Let me guess. You founded it, and sculpted the columns that hold up the barracks with a butter knife.~ [FWKLSYF7]
@1609 = ~Your petty sarcasm cannot touch the honor of the Order, but it certainly speaks volumes about you. The only "order" in your future is an order for textiles and knick-nacks.~
@1610 = ~I'm not taking that bait. I like a good paladin as much as the next guy, but to hear you talk, the whole thing would fall apart without you.~
@1611 = ~Your interruptions wear at my patience. I spoke not for you, boy, but for <CHARNAME>, who can appreciate both the Order and my significant contributions.~
@1612 = ~My lady, before we were so rudely interrupted, I had asked a question of you. I must dare ask it again: are you at all versed with the Order of the Most Radiant Heart?~
@1613 = ~Not very much, I'm afraid.~
@1614 = ~A little.~
@1615 = ~All I know is that it is full of arrogant and pompous knights like yourself.~
@1616 = ~I don't care to discuss this right now, Anomen.~
@1617 = ~Why don't you just hire a minstrel? You could save your energy for fighting, rather than constantly singing your own praises.~ [FWKLSYF8]
@1618 = ~Tread carefully, sorcerer, before you press this line of inquiry. I have had more than enough of your impudent interruptions.~
@1619 = ~Well, obviously it's not making much of an impression on you. Still as transparent as ever.~
@1620 = ~You'll get an impression soon enough, if you do not take exceedingly good care.~
@1621 = ~Apologies, my lady. Nothing would help me clear my mind of this unpleasantness more than being able to tell you how I came into Helm's service.~
@1622 = ~Please. I'd like to hear the tale.~
@1623 = ~I've no interest in hearing about it.~
@1624 = ~I thought you were trying to become a knight.~
@1625 = ~We should be careful, <CHARNAME>... if the town's ranger and an adventuring party are already missing, we don't want to become part of the statistics.~
@1626 = ~Amazing...but I imagine she would give almost anything to be able to turn it off.~
@1627 = ~Well, you might start by laying off the dirty looks in my direction, then...~
@1628 = ~What goes around, comes around. Perhaps your turn is coming soon.~
@1629 = ~We've been pushed around by just about everyone since we got here. I think it's time we stop acting automatically and figure out if there isn't a better deal to be had.~
@1630 = ~Are you sure? I'll bet your contract is vacated once there's nothing left to guard.~
@1631 = ~That was a very good try, <CHARNAME>. You almost had him going.~
@1632 = ~This is a despicable deal, <CHARNAME>! You--you are on your own to deal with the consequences.~
@1633 = ~Begone, demon!  There is nothing for you here.  She who has summoned you is dead.~
@1634 = ~(remain silent)~
@1635 = ~(Wait)~
@1636 = ~Actually, we learned the hard way that turnips are a losing proposition. Some crazy gnome once talked my father into investing into ten thousand tons of turnip futures. It did not end well...but then, you're all giving me this look that says you don't care. Never mind.~
@1637 = ~This almost sounds too implausible to be true, <CHARNAME>, but I can't imagine anyone burying themselves just to set some sort of trap for us.~
@1638 = ~You have either been cowed or seduced by the evil of the Cowled Wizards, <CHARNAME>, and I will have no part of this, or of you.~
@1639 = ~You are actually going to support this slaver? Don't you believe in people having the freedom to live their own lives?~
@1640 = ~Anomen, you and <CHARNAME> both have a hell of a lot of nerve. When was the last time you were chained up and forced to fight for someone else's entertainment?~
@1641 = ~These rabble have clearly earned their station, and if they were truly worthy to be free men, they would break their own shackles. Most of these men are likely deserters and escaped prisoners, else how would they run afoul of slavers to begin with?~
@1642 = ~Is it just me, <CHARNAME>, or is this lady really creepy?~
@1643 = ~Wow. I really hope you're proud of yourself.~
@1644 = ~Didn't your ma ever tell you the ladies can't see what you have to give them under all those robes? Give us a look.~
@1645 = ~You must be joking.~
@1646 = ~Oh, my. I don't know how I'll get to sleep tonight.~
@1647 = ~Kelsey? Is that you?~
@1648 = ~Aye, Busya...Guildmistress now, I see?~
@1649 = ~Yes, I have assumed the post here. And you, Kelsey? How has business found you lately?~
@1650 = ~Business has been slow, but I have never been happier. I have been travelling with <CHARNAME>. She is very dear to me, I hope you will have a chance to speak.~
@1651 = ~Business has been slow, but the world finds me well, I would have to say. I am travelling with <CHARNAME>, at least for a time.~
@1652 = ~I am glad to hear it. <CHARNAME>, I hope you realize what an asset you have in our man Kelsey.~
@1653 = ~I certainly do appreciate his talents, yes.~
@1654 = ~He is competent, but let's not exaggerate.~
@1655 = ~Actually, he is just filling space until I find someone better.~
@1656 = ~I treasure him above all else.~
@1657 = ~I do not know how much Kelsey has told you about his travels in the past, but this is not the first time we have met.~
@1658 = ~Some years... four summers ago, I believe, Kelsey rode with a caravan I was leading into Trademeet. It was high value, high risk-spices, crafted goods, even a small assortment of magical goods and scrolls... carried discreetly, you understand.~
@1659 = ~Still many miles out to the east, we were hit by raiders who knew our cargo was valuable. Their archers took out the two guard captains almost immediately, and we were being overrun.~
@1660 = ~We were all in danger of losing a fortune, if not our lives.~
@1661 = ~Kelsey saved us all. He seemed to be the only one who remembered the scrolls we were carrying.~
@1662 = ~After doing what he could with his own spells, he raced over to the wagon where the scrolls were stocked, took out--what was it, again, Kelsey?~
@1663 = ~Exaggerate? No, I don't exaggerate about people.~
@1664 = ~You must run your company as you see fit, but I believe you may be underestimating him.~
@1665 = ~Then I am pleased for the both of you.~
@1666 = ~Chain Lightning.~
@1667 = ~Yes, of course. Grabbed a Chain Lightning scroll, and read it. The bandit vanguard was killed instantly, and the stragglers were cut down by our rather inspired remaining guards.~
@1668 = ~It... was hardly that amazing, Busya. I simply reached for the first scroll case I could find. I could just as easily have found an Identify scroll and looked like an idiot when I tried to cast it at them.~
@1669 = ~It doesn't matter how you did it, Kelsey. We will always be grateful to you for your quick thinking.~
@1670 = ~This has been a nice ego boost, Busya.~
@1671 = ~But, perhaps you should speak with <CHARNAME> if there is any pressing business.~
@1672 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. Please let me know when you have a moment.~
@1673 = ~I... don't... excuse me a moment, I feel sort of ill.~
@1674 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for aiding me again. All I can do is apologize once more for involving you. I thought this sort of thing only happened to...other people...~
@1675 = ~That's all right. Just help me loot the bodies and I'll call it even.~
@1676 = ~This had better be the last psychopath. My patience wears thin.~
@1677 = ~You would do the same for me, I expect.~
@1678 = ~Nothing like a little gallows humor after a battle.~
@1679 = ~...look, I said I was sorry. You, of all people, should know I can't make that kind of promise!~
@1680 = ~I try, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad we can count on one another.~
@1681 = ~A stupid question, I know, but are you feeling completely yourself? You look quite ill...perhaps we should rest a while.~
@1682 = ~I will be as well as can be expected. Fall back in line.~
@1683 = ~Mind your own business, sorcerer. If you don't have my soul in that pack of yours, your words are meaningless to me.~
@1684 = ~It was the strangest feeling, as though I was not truly myself, but I am fine now.~
@1685 = ~All right. But don't be afraid to call a halt. Nobody expects you to be at your best at a time like this.~
@1686 = ~Really. I'll do everything I can to help get it back, you know.~
@1687 = ~Well, shout out if it starts happening again. If you drop dead of exhaustion, you'll never get your soul back.~
@1688 = ~By Waukeen's purse! <CHARNAME>, are you all right?~
@1689 = ~What am I saying? I think you just became Bhaal incarnate! You could kill us all! Are WE all right?~
@1690 = ~I already knew Irenicus had to be stopped, but I think we just got a new timetable. We're all in trouble unless you can get your soul back and get that...thing under control.~
@1691 = ~Dearest...you have been pushing yourself too hard, and it shows. Can I help you at all?~ [FWKLSYB9]
@1692 = ~Get away, Kelsey! I think something terrible is about to happen!~
@1693 = ~Run, idiot! Your life is about to be forfeit!~
@1694 = ~Back away, I may not be able to control myself.~
@1695 = ~<CHARNAME>, I can't hear anything you're saying, please try to...wait...no...NO! <CHARNAME>, don't!~
@1696 = ~You...you were a nightmare, a beast...you could have killed me...~
@1697 = ~We need to repair whatever it is that Irenicus damaged, and quickly...before we lose each other forever.~
@1698 = ~Those prisoners are very disturbed...they could make some real trouble for each other, and for us, unless we provide them with some focus. Fast.~
@1699 = ~So ends that miserable excuse for a twisted wretch...but then, this isn't really over unless you say it is. What of it, <CHARNAME>? Are you...fixed?~ [FWKLSYE6]
@1700 = ~Kelsey: once a directionless hireling, now a trusted friend and lover. You have each drawn strength from the other, and that link shows as he seems to anticipate what you must say to him.~
@1701 = ~Kelsey... I ---~
@1702 = ~Kelsey, the young sorcerer, who has a newfound sense of confidence and direction since joining your company. Is he truly prepared to face what you know is to come?~
@1703 = ~Kelsey, Irenicus is my problem, not yours. You don't need to face him.~
@1704 = ~Kelsey, this will not be an easy fight...some or all of us may die. I can't force you to come.~
@1705 = ~This isn't a game. I need men with me willing to fight and die. Are you up for it?~
@1706 = ~Shhhh. You do not need to make a speech or convince me of anything, <CHARNAME>.~ [FWKLSYE8]
@1707 = ~I know what's waiting on the other side of that staircase...the man who stole your soul, and will try to kill us all to keep it. Him, I can never forgive, and I will do what I must against him.~ [FWKLSYE9]
@1708 = ~You, on the other hand, are the woman who stole my heart. You, I can never repay.~ [FWKLSYF0]
@1709 = ~You have given me the confidence to embrace what I am, and the courage to realize what being myself means. You have loved me, and allowed yourself to be loved...and you have done it all while this man put you through a living hell.~ [FWKLSYF1]
@1710 = ~<CHARNAME>, if... if I say much more I'm afraid I will break down and cry. Let me just say this: I love you, I need you, and I am with you until the end.~ [FWKLSYF2]
@1711 = ~Irenicus represents everything that is wrong with power, and everything I should be using my own powers to fight. Working with you to defeat him means making a difference, <CHARNAME>. I'm with you.~ [FWKLSYF3]
@1712 = ~Oh, wow, this is so great. I had a vision that we would meet, and here you are!~
@1713 = ~Yeah, as I was saying, I had this vision that I would meet this really horny elf today, right? So I told my boyfriend Drongo the Skull Crusher--he's a pit fighter from Beregost--all about it.~
@1714 = ~Drongo and I haven't been getting along so good lately, but you know what he said? He said that if anybody so much as laid eyes on me, he would bite their ears off! Isn't that sweet?~
@1715 = ~I don't know...Drongo seemed really serious. And you've got those juicy, pointy ears, and I really wouldn't trust the bartender in this joint to sew them back on, you know what I'm saying?~
@1716 = ~My sincerest greetings. You have such a sweet, innocent face, yet I detect the blooming femininity of a girl no longer. Please, allow me to taste of your fruits of adulthood.~
@1717 = ~Then let us defy the fates no longer! Salvanas will worship at your feet, soothe your aches and delicate scars with tender kisses, and caress every bit of you with precision and accuracy!~
@1718 = ~Oh, my lovely, you fear what is to come, that is why you tell such pretty lies! Come, let Salvanas make you forget all your inhibitions.~
@1719 = ~Why...why, I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to her, over there! Excuse me.~
@1720 = ~You have taken too much already!  You will return both Imoen's soul and Kelsey!~
@1721 = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Kelsey and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@1722 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Kelsey alone.  He is very important to me.~
@1723 = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment.  The theft of Kelsey will not save you.~
@1724 = ~I am...yours to command, Mistress Bodhi.~
@1725 = ~My newest prize? My sorcerous servant, who serves me with dedication he could never show you, <CHARNAME>? Why would you want him back now?~
@1726 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Kelsey into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had him.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost him.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan...~
@1727 = ~An interesting ploy, though I am sure his fate will still serve as an example.~
@1728 = ~Precious, isn't he? Even though the process is not complete, Kelsey will still do my bidding without a shred of doubt, right down to draining the life from your worthless carcass.~
@1729 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@1730 = ~Take you and your man Kelsey there. So sweet standing together, how could you bear the loss?~
@1731 = ~I am not afraid of you. I've seen for myself that you cannot harm <CHARNAME>.~
@1732 = ~A lovely thought, but you misunderstand me. <CHARNAME>, follow me and you will lose more than you can imagine. Watch as I take what I wish from you even now!~
@1733 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Kelsey.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@1734 = ~This sounds wrong in a dozen different ways. I've heard some scary rumors about the Corthala family, but I think the Wizards are pulling our strings. Try to give this Valygar a chance before you strike, will you?~
@1735 = ~I can't believe this...you...how long until you sell all of us out? You are beyond contempt, and I am leaving before you slit my throat with my own dagger!~
@1736 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is bound to be a trap of the lowest order. Please tell me you know better than to blindly take a commission from these fascists.~
@1737 = ~Fools? Hardly. The only fool here is the cantrip-tosser who thought he could con <CHARNAME> into cold-blooded murder. You'll get nothing and no one from us.~
@1738 = ~Sure. He probably just has some hemlock for us to put in the afternoon tea of one of the Council of Six.~
@1739 = ~I am... shocked, that you would even consider this! The odd pilfered chest was one thing, but making your living off of theft? Leading a band of thieves?~
@1740 = ~<CHARNAME>... I respect that your talents are a part of who you are, but please don't do this. I couldn't look you in the eye, not in the same way.~
@1741 = ~It's just a temporary means to an end, so we can be powerful enough to rescue Imoen.~
@1742 = ~It's just a temporary means to an end. I need enough resources to catch up with Irenicus.~
@1743 = ~If not me, he will just install some other psychopath like Mae'Var. I can use the guild to help people.~
@1744 = ~It's my life. Back off.~
@1745 = ~If it would truly bother you that much, then I will not take the position.~
@1746 = ~All right, <CHARNAME>. I can accept that. You are right, there are bigger issues to consider.~
@1747 = ~But I hope you do understand why I said something, why it would be upsetting to have someone so close to me, in a role like that.~
@1748 = ~I am glad to hear you say that, <CHARNAME>. I admit that I am more than a little curious what you have in mind... but I will trust your judgement.~
@1749 = ~If hurting people for your own personal gain is that important to you, then I WILL back off.~
@1750 = ~<CHARNAME>... I wish I could believe you, but the power, the possibilities. I worry what that temptation would do.~
@1751 = ~And I have seen enough to make me suspect the worst. I hope your new life... pleases you.~
@1752 = ~(sigh) I feel guilty for having to ask you for that, <CHARNAME>, but it really would have made me uncomfortable. Thank you.~
@1753 = ~Really. I am very disappointed to know that you think it is perfectly acceptable to live by stealing the hard earned wages of others.~
@1754 = ~There is a saying about the "lesser of two evils" that justifies all of this, I'm sure. Almost.~
@1755 = ~This is no trick or dying wizard's last illusion...we really are in Hell, aren't we? I hope that your strange powers mean that the trip was not one-way, but I will fight by your side even if we are stuck here.~ [FWKLSYE7]
@1756 = ~There once was a mage accidental--~
@1757 = ~Hey, don't I know you? You're the crazy rhyming gnome who sold my father those turnip futures contracts years ago!~
@1758 = ~--Whose powers grew beyond the ornamental--~
@1759 = ~It IS you! I'd like to have a little chat with you about that!~
@1760 = ~Eeep! Celvan's...ah, been mistaken for someone else! Must listen to the gods somewhere else!~
@1761 = ~We do not belong here, Irenicus! We are leaving, and we can kill you again if we have to!~ [FWKLSYG3]
@1762 = ~This arrangement disturbs me, <CHARNAME>. Greatly. If I see what she is, then you should see what she is, and I am shocked you would agree to be her agent.~

// @1800 - 1944 = J#KlsyJ

@1800 = ~I have no idea who you are or what you are talking about.~ [FWKLSYC0]
@1801 = ~Ceara...?~ [FWKLSYC1]
@1802 = ~... Ceara... Oh, no!~ [FWKLSYC2]
@1803 = ~<CHARNAME>, these people work for a crackpot wizardess. She practically stalked me all over Athkatla last year and rambled on and on about her research to boost her magical powers.~
@1804 = ~She seemed entirely too friendly, in a maniacal way... the whole thing gave me the impression it was more about dissecting me than bedding me.~
@1805 = ~The answer is no. I have no interest in seeing her again.~
@1806 = ~Forget it. I'm not going anywhere with you and I suggest you stop threatening us. <CHARNAME> and I can certainly defend ourselves.~ [FWKLSYC3]
@1807 = ~What? Wait... ~ [FWKLSYC4]
@1808 = ~That's insane! And I have no intention of letting you do that to me!~
@1809 = ~Thank you very much for sticking up for me, <CHARNAME>, but you don't know Ceara. Somehow, I think she will be back.~
@1810 = ~Try not to worry about her. That crew didn't look so tough anyway.~
@1811 = ~Just don't cause any more problems.~
@1812 = ~You are too much trouble. I bailed you out, but you are on your own.~
@1813 = ~I'll try. And I'll let you know if I see those goons coming again. Thank you, again.~
@1814 = ~I can't help it if I am popular with lunatics. Present company, uh, excepted.~
@1815 = ~I... I would like to argue with you, but if you think I am endangering your mission, I will go. Thank you for sticking by me for as long as you did.~
@1816 = ~Finally, the freak fades into the sunset. (lucky for him, he was about to fade into the Sunfire if he lingered much longer...)~
@1817 = ~What can I say? I am sorry I got you into this. I swear, if I had any idea that Ceara person was this... bizarre, I would have warned you about the situation when we met.~ [FWKLSYC5]
@1818 = ~Try not to worry about her. If that was the best she had, no problem.~
@1819 = ~I don't even understand where she would get a goon squad like that. She must have Cowled Wizard support for her "research"... oh, I don't even want to think about it. Let's just get moving.~
@1820 = ~Not again. Look, whatever it is you're selling, I am not buying. Especially not after all of this harassment.~ [FWKLSYC6]
@1821 = ~Lady, I remember you being incredibly weird. Now, you are incredibly weird and incredibly unpleasant. So, no, I do not feel particularly special.~ [FWKLSYC7]
@1822 = ~We talked about sorcery, as I recall, for a good hour or two when I thought that would get you off my back. Beyond that, you are on your own.~ [FWKLSYC8]
@1823 = ~I did not like the sound of what your hirelings seemed to imply you wanted to do to me beyond just talking.~ [FWKLSYC9]
@1824 = ~You will not have anything to forget! I am not going anywhere with you.~
@1825 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm sorry you're being dragged into this yet again, but I hope you will stand with me...I don't give myself much of a chance against that group alone.~
@1826 = ~No! This young man is under our protection!~
@1827 = ~I... don't... excuse me a moment, I feel sort of ill.~
@1828 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for aiding me again. All I can do is apologize once more for involving you. I thought this sort of thing only happened to other people...~
@1829 = ~That's all right. Just help me loot the bodies and I'll call it even.~
@1830 = ~This had better be the last psychopath. My patience wears thin.~
@1831 = ~You would do the same for me, I expect.~
@1832 = ~Nothing like a little gallows humor after a battle.~
@1833 = ~...look, I said I was sorry. You, of all people, should know I can't make that kind of promise!~
@1834 = ~I try, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad we can count on one another.~
@1835 = ~Kelsey! Why have you forced me to chase you all over Amn?~ [FWCEAR09]
@1836 = ~But... have I not made it plain how special you are to me, Kelsey? Do you not... remember the first time we met? When I first saw your face...?~ [FWCEAR00]
@1837 = ~No. No, Kelsey, this is not up to you any longer. You see, I am at a critical stage in my research. Invocation, necromancy, transmutation... even wild magic are all as child's play to me now. But sorcery! Sorcery is the discipline only you can help me master, Kelsey.~ [FWCEAR01]
@1838 = ~We must all make sacrifices for the greater good, Kelsey. And I swear, I will never forget yours. Come, Kelsey.~ [FWCEAR02]
@1839 = ~As I said, this is not a choice. You see that I have not come alone. We are more than capable of carrying you off... and I have no qualms about carrying you off in pieces.~
@1840 = ~I suggest you not interfere. I do not take kindly to outsiders meddling in the course of scientific research.~ [FWCEAR06]
@1841 = ~Well, prepare to be interfered with, because Kelsey stays with us.~
@1842 = ~I hate being threatened. Back off.~
@1843 = ~Hey, if he's more valuable to you than he is to me, be my guest.~
@1844 = ~You have no vision, and you are an inconvenience we can overcome.~ [FWCEAR03]
@1845 = ~You do not know what threats are! Once I have extracted the secret of sorcery, THEN you will feel threatened! Oh, but that's right, I will have already killed you. I forgot.~ [FWCEAR04]
@1846 = ~Ahhh... sweet, sweet Kelsey, at peace at last. So pretty... what fun we shall have together, exploring how you will make me more powerful...~ [FWCEAR05]
@1847 = ~(ahem) As for you, <CHARNAME>... I am glad we were able to reach a peaceful solution. I will be sure to keep you updated on my research. You seem a powerful specimen yourself...~ [FWCEAR07]
@1848 = ~That was basely done, <CHARNAME>. I believe that young man is in considerable peril in their hands.~
@1849 = ~Oh, very well, big man. You shall have the fight you so clearly deserve.~ [FWCEAR08]
@1850 = ~At last! Kelsey. My lady Ceara is so very disappointed that you have not paid her a visit since returning to Amn. She is quite... ah...~ [FWMERR00]
@1851 = ~Inconsolable, yes. Quite inconsolable. And wounded, at that.~ [FWMERR01]
@1852 = ~Lilla, this is not going well at all. Are we absolutely certain that this is Kelsey?~ [FWMERR02]
@1853 = ~My associates and I are engaged for a variety of purposes by Ceara, a lady whose talent and charm we thought you were well familiar with.~ [FWMERR03]
@1854 = ~Ah, well, as you say, I have a written invitation from my lady and she would SO love to see you again...~
@1855 = ~Really, I must insist. Forcefully.~ [FWMERR04]
@1856 = ~And I assure you, the more you cooperate, the longer you will live.~ [FWMERR06]
@1857 = ~End of discussion. Do you give him to us, or do we take him? We would be pleased to compensate the party... say, 2500 gold and this rod, which proved most useful in locating Kelsey and others like him.~
@1858 = ~Sure, it's a deal. Take him.~
@1859 = ~No! We will fight to defend our comrade!~
@1860 = ~I don't understand... what is this all about?~
@1861 = ~Oh, the heroic types. Very well, we'll simply bring her a slightly battered sorcerer.~
@1862 = ~(sigh) It's very simple. My lady Ceara, already quite talented in the ways of magic, is constantly seeking ways to improve herself and her fellow mages.~ [FWMERR07]
@1863 = ~This man here, as you probably realize, has certain natural magical abilities that intrigue us. We wish to know more about him and how he... works.~
@1864 = ~A pleasure doing business with you. We will be sure to update you when our lady Ceara makes a breakthrough.~ [FWMERR05]
@1865 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I think we should have helped Kelsey. I think they're going to kill him!~
@1866 = ~Good riddance to miscasting rubbish, I say. Those freaks deserve each other.~
@1867 = ~Magic brings everyone to a sad end, it seems.~
@1868 = ~End of discussion. Do you give him to us, or do we take him?~
@1869 = ~Sure, I'll trade you a mage for 2500 gold and this item of yours.~
@1870 = ~What if I were to pay you to forget we had this conversation?~
@1871 = ~Kelsey stays with us.~
@1872 = ~Quiet, you, I know what I'm doing. Now, you were saying you might... wish to make a monetary contribution to my lady's cause?~
@1873 = ~Certainly. 500 gold and you walk away.~
@1874 = ~Why not? I happen to have 1500 gold on me right here.~
@1875 = ~Yes, I think 4000 gold should be more than sufficient.~
@1876 = ~Actually, I've changed my mind, just take him.~
@1877 = ~I've changed my mind. No deals!~
@1878 = ~No, no, that won't do at all. I'm afraid we'll have to do this the hard way.~ [FWMERR08]
@1879 = ~Yes... yes, I think this will help my lady...~ [FWMERR09]
@1880 = ~Immeasurably, yes. Farewell, then.~ [FWMERR10]
@1881 = ~No, she hasn't come alone... in fact, I've brought reinforcements.~
@1882 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for your contribution... it was well-spent, as you can see.~
@1883 = ~Yeah. Reinforcements.~
@1884 = ~Distraught? Wounded? Disturbed? Inconsolable?~ [FWLILL00]
@1885 = ~Oh, yes. You can see as well as I that he matches Ceara's description.~ [FWLILL01]
@1886 = ~Come, Kelsey, think of the possibilities. Your biological gift for magic combined with Ceara's insight will give you an immortal legacy.~ [FWLILL02]
@1887 = ~Don't do it, Merritt...~
@1888 = ~Considerably? Immeasurably?~ [FWLILL03]
@1889 = ~I thought you were worth helping, but I see now that you are just an overblown bully. I hope to never see you or the likes of you again.~ [FWKLSYB5]
@1890 = ~I'm... I'm back! I knew you would find a way to beat her. Thank you for saving me from that hell... I am pleased you felt I was worth the trouble.~ [FWKLSYB8]
@1891 = ~Of course you are, my love. I would never give up on you.~
@1892 = ~Let's not make a habit of this. Honestly, one would think that when a vampire tries to bite you, you might duck. I'm surprised I bothered.~
@1893 = ~Of course... staking vampires and deciphering centuries-old mysteries and invoking forgotten gods is all just a day's work for me.~
@1894 = ~I feel warm all over hearing you say that. Take my arm, then, and let us get back to the road.~
@1895 = ~Ah, well, I may have been exaggerating slightly when I said never. I cannot take you with the party at the moment.~
@1896 = ~Yes, let's.~
@1897 = ~What? But I never... I need... oh, very well. What shall I do until you need my services once more?~
@1898 = ~Head back to Waukeen's Promenade, we will find you there.~
@1899 = ~Stay here, enjoy the scenery.~
@1900 = ~Nothing like a little abuse for the recently un-undead. I promise to be extra-vigilant against mythic she-beasts in the future, then. Can we just go now before I say something cross?~
@1901 = ~Not exactly, no. I cannot take you with the party at the moment.~
@1902 = ~You are so pretty when you brag. Take my arm, then, and let us get back to the road.~
@1903 = ~Sorry, Kelsey. Your life is yours, but I cannot take you with the party at the moment.~
@1904 = ~So we meet again. Do you need a sorcerer with an eye for a good deal, or are you simply passing through?~ [FWKLSY50]
@1905 = ~Yes, Kelsey, I would like you in my group again.~
@1906 = ~No, I have no need for you now.~
@1907 = ~I'd hate to leave the group now. This is a lot more interesting than balancing the family's books.~ [FWKLSY51]
@1908 = ~Sorry, Kelsey. I need to make a change.~
@1909 = ~Then stay, we still need your talents.~
@1910 = ~All right. Where should I meet up with you?~
@1911 = ~Head to Waukeen's Promenade, we'll meet you outside the Adventurer's Mart.~
@1912 = ~Stay put, that way I'll know where to find you.~
@1913 = ~Hello! My name is Kelsey. I've been hoping we would meet before long. I thought I saw you in the middle of that firestorm in the Promenade... anyone who can walk away from a pack of Shadow Thieves and Cowled Wizards must be worth knowing, I figure.~ [FWKLSY00]
@1914 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@1915 = ~Who the hell are you, my biographer?~
@1916 = ~You saw what happened in the Promenade? What, did you just stand there? I could have used a hand!~
@1917 = ~Get lost, I'm busy.~
@1918 = ~I'm in Athkatla on business, helping my family look after their trading accounts. But my work is just about finished, and I'm looking for a new challenge. And it looks like you lost a friend in the Promenade. Perhaps I can help you?~
@1919 = ~What could you do for me?~
@1920 = ~Perhaps you should have helped me in the Promenade!~
@1921 = ~No thanks, kid.~
@1922 = ~I'm a mage, of sorts. Let's just say it's not exactly a conscious choice. My magic is a little different than your average conjurer or transmuter, but that only means the Cowled Wizards are even MORE eager to squish me under their thumb and find out what makes me tick, given half a chance.~
@1923 = ~I'd like to make up for before, however. I am ready to follow your lead.~
@1924 = ~What were you doing back in the Promenade, twiddling your thumbs?~
@1925 = ~All right, fall into formation, Kelsey.~
@1926 = ~Forget it, if you wouldn't help me before, I doubt I can trust you now.~
@1927 = ~Terrific! It'll be nice to put my skills to good use for a change. There are worse things than being a glorified part-time accountant, but I think I'm truly happiest when I can help people with the talents that the gods have gifted, or cursed me with.~
@1928 = ~Whatever. Let's go.~
@1929 = ~Did you happen to see the guy who exploded a half-dozen of the Cowled Wizards? That's Irenicus, a powerful wizard, and I'm going after him.~
@1930 = ~My plan is to rescue Imoen from the Cowled Wizards, no matter the cost. I hope you're ready to oppose them, if necessary.~
@1931 = ~I heard about that, yes...well, nobody looks quite as dangerous when you've got a reliable companion at your back. Count me in.~
@1932 = ~Imoen is your spellcaster friend? Sure, I would be happy to help. I hope the Cowled Wizards aren't too rough on her in the meantime, for her sake.~
@1933 = ~Imoen? That's the wizard girl's name? Sounds like a plan to me. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, you two aren't...together, are you? Does she have a boyfriend?~
@1934 = ~For starters, it was pretty hard to tell who was doing what to whom back there. And for another thing, my "help" probably would have gotten me carted off to wherever they took your spell-slinging friends.~
@1935 = ~You're a mage, then?~
@1936 = ~You're a wizard, boy? I thought you looked like a weakling.~
@1937 = ~This is fascinating, but I've got other things to do.~
@1938 = ~All right. Let me know if I can be of any help some other time. There's still a few more merchants in town I should take to dinner, I suppose.~
@1939 = ~If there's room for me in your group, I would still really like to be a part of it.~ [FWKlsy49]
@1940 = ~Sure, Kelsey.~
@1941 = ~Not now.~
@1942 = ~All right, but keep me in mind for the future.~
@1943 = ~No offense, Kelsey, but I thought sorcerers were all twisted old men who live in dark towers brooding over potions. That is what you are, isn't it?~
@1944 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>. Do you think there is anything this freakish puppy can do that I couldn't do better with my pinky finger? Bah! (I should have known, monkeys love little dogs.)~

// @1950 - 2056 = FWKelseyFlirtModule

@1955 = ~(Tickle Kelsey)~
@1956 = ~(Hug Kelsey)~
@1957 = ~Do you think you could rub my shoulders?~
@1958 = ~I just wanted to tell you that you are a sweet fellow, Kelsey. Thank you for being my friend.~
@1959 = ~(Leave Kelsey unmolested)~
@1960 = ~Mmmmmmmph!~ [FWKLSYH1]
@1961 = ~Mmmmmm! What was that for?~ [FWKLSYH2]
@1962 = ~For you.~
@1963 = ~I thought we both needed it.~
@1964 = ~Don't question me, it's not healthy.~
@1965 = ~Thanks!~
@1966 = ~Ummmmm... okay...~
@1967 = ~I think you're right. I won't argue. You're the boss, after all.~
@1968 = ~Mmmmmm. Yum.~ [FWKLSYH3]
@1969 = ~Mmmmmmph!!~ [FWKLSYH1]
@1970 = ~(Kelsey's right hand closes around your left. While certainly not the biggest or strongest in Amn, it feels warm, and genuine, and reassuring.)~
@1971 = ~(Kelsey looks down as he takes your hand, then turns his head upward and gazes into your eyes. He smiles, opens his mouth as if to speak... but says nothing.)~
@1972 = ~Everything all right, my favorite heroine?~ [FWKLSYH5]
@1973 = ~Of course. I just wanted to touch you.~
@1974 = ~Now it is.~
@1975 = ~Yes. I only wanted to say hello.~
@1976 = ~Oh!~
@1977 = ~That's...really a nice thing to say, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@1978 = ~Then, hello, <CHARNAME>. I'm always happy to see you.~
@1979 = ~Oooh! Cold hands!~ [FWKLSYH6]
@1980 = ~Hey! Come back here! You get the same coming back!~ [FWKLSYH7]
@1981 = ~Please! What will the goblins say if they see that?~ [FWKLSYH8]
@1982 = ~Hey!~ [FWKLSYH9]
@1983 = ~Ahhhhh! No, no, no, no, not now!~ [FWKLSYI0]
@1984 = ~(laughing) No, no, stop, stop!~ [FWKLSYI1]
@1985 = ~(laughing) Agh! Oooh, you are going to get it!~ [FWKLSYI2]
@1986 = ~(Kelsey seems startled by your sudden embrace, but surprises you in return by holding you quite firmly.)~
@1987 = ~(He seems reluctant to let go when the moment is over.)~
@1988 = ~(You hold Kelsey close and take secret pleasure in the press of his body and the smell of his essence.)~
@1989 = ~(Kelsey gently holds your head to his shoulder, idly twirling a few lengths of your hair.)~
@1990 = ~I... needed to feel you, just then. Thank you.~ [FWKLSYI3]
@1991 = ~Just need to be held?~ [FWKLSYI4]
@1992 = ~I... I think so, yes.~
@1993 = ~Shhhh. No talking. Hugging.~
@1994 = ~Only by you.~
@1995 = ~No, I need lots of things, but this is fine for now.~
@1996 = ~(Kelsey says nothing more, wrapping his arms around you until you feel at ease.)~
@1997 = ~(Something tells you Kelsey may have needed this even more than you.)~
@1998 = ~Ooooh, flattery. Come here, <CHARNAME>.~
@1999 = ~I... ah. Hmmm. You can tell me more about that when you're ready, I think.~
@2000 = ~Mmmmm. Promise me you'll show me what else you had in mind later. For now...come here, <CHARNAME>.~
@2001 = ~Mmmmmmm. Thanks. Hey, you smell good.~ [FWKLSYI5]
@2002 = ~Thank you. I think you're great, too.~ [FWKLSYI6]
@2003 = ~That's really nice of you to say. I am glad we met as well.~ [FWKLSYI7]
@2004 = ~It's my good fortune, really. Waukeen can't be all THAT missing...she's looking out for us.~ [FWKLSYI8]
@2005 = ~(Kelsey kisses you--briefly, impulsively.)~
@2006 = ~(Kelsey flushes slightly, and takes your hand.)~
@2007 = ~Thanks.~ [FWKLSYI9]
@2008 = ~Oh! Sure thing, <CHARNAME>.~ [FWKLSYJ1]
@2009 = ~Wow, you really are tense. Try to relax, there's nothing you can't get through with a good friend or two.~ [FWKLSYL1]
@2010 = ~Okay... here, let me get your pack off...~ [FWKLSYJ2]
@2011 = ~(Kelsey begins to rub your shoulders--his approach is not especially skilled, but it is tender, and you feel a warmth come over you.)~
@2012 = ~I would be glad to. In fact, thank you for asking. I'm not a healer, but I'll do what I can...~ [FWKLSYJ3]
@2013 = ~(Kelsey works at your shoulders and spine for a spell, and you begin to feel better. You could swear he took the opportunity to kiss you gently on the back of the neck...)~
@2014 = ~(You approach Kelsey, and tingle slightly as you think of how much you have grown to rely on each other in body and spirit as of late.)~ [FWKLSYMU]
@2015 = ~Hi, lovely.~ [FWKLSYJ0]
@2016 = ~(whisper) You are going to get it this evening, Kelsey.~
@2017 = ~(whisper) I have been thinking about us, Kelsey... and I am ready to love you, this eve.~
@2018 = ~(Kiss Kelsey deeply)~
@2019 = ~(Rub Kelsey's back)~
@2020 = ~I love you, Kelsey.~
@2021 = ~(You work your hands under Kelsey's cloak and into his robes and work at his tired muscles.)~
@2022 = ~(He groans under your attentions, and slumps slightly forward, relaxed, until you release him.)~
@2023 = ~Unnnnnnnnnhhh...~ [FWKLSYK2]
@2024 = ~Thank you very, very much.~ [FWKLSYK3]
@2025 = ~Mmmmmm... that feels good, but really, I'm okay. Maybe you can get me later.~ [FWKLSYK4]
@2026 = ~(Ignoring his mild protest, you slide Kelsey's pack to the ground and begin kneading at his shoulders and neck with purpose.)~
@2027 = ~(The heat radiating from his skin through your fingertips is exciting, and you suspect that more than his back muscles appreciate your touch.)~
@2028 = ~(Kelsey says nothing, and for a moment you think he actually may not have heard you properly.)~
@2029 = ~(Then he turns slowly away, does a happy skip in place, and flashes you a smile.)~
@2030 = ~You read my mind, dear... it's definitely a date.~ [FWKLSYJ9]
@2031 = ~(Kelsey's eyes widen slightly, as he clearly knows exactly what you have in mind. In his eyes, you could swear you see a reflection of yourself, undressed already in his mind.)~
@2032 = ~Ooooh! Count on it.~ [FWKLSYK0]
@2033 = ~(Kelsey beams uncontrollably.)~
@2034 = ~I will always be happy to hear you say that, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad neither of us can get enough of, well, each other!~ [FWKLSYK1]
@2035 = ~(Kelsey's lips yield tenderly to yours at first, but after a few seconds you find yourself practically reeling from the force of his emotion.)~
@2036 = ~(He parts from you reluctantly when the moment is finally over, leaving you slightly numb and more than a little breathless.)~
@2037 = ~Mmmmmm. You are my favorite heroine... and the tastiest. May I have seconds?~ [FWKLSYJ8]
@2038 = ~(Kelsey smiles broadly as he sees you approach and guesses what you want--a little too broadly to be perfectly kissable, actually, but that doesn't stop you.)~
@2039 = ~(His smile fades, however, as the passion builds between you. He tangles one hand in your hair, and rests the other purposefully at the base of your spine. You share the unspoken wish that this escape from reality could be forever.)~
@2040 = ~(As your lips meet, your mind wanders briefly to Irenicus and the struggles you know will follow. You guiltily turn your full attention back to the matter at hand, and Kelsey responds to your renewed enthusiasm.)~
@2041 = ~(Without words, Kelsey's mouth convinces you that he has never loved another as much as he loves you.)~
@2042 = ~I love you too.~ [FWKLSYJ5]
@2043 = ~You're sweet to say so. But you know, I love you too.~ [FWKLSYJ6]
@2044 = ~I love you too... and thank you, for everything.~ [FWKLSYJ7]

@2047 = ~I am really sure I want this, Kelsey.~
@2048 = ~I was just having a crummy night when you asked, Kelsey. Of course I want you!~
@2049 = ~No, Kelsey... I am not really sure, but I can't make you wait any longer.~
@2050 = ~No, I am not really sure, Kelsey... but I want to find out what I am not sure about.~
@2051 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>... I am glad you changed your mind. I am really looking forward to this.~ [FWKLSYK5]
@2052 = ~I will try to be everything you expect, and everything you deserve...~ [FWKLSYK6]
@2053 = ~I... I appreciate what you are trying to do for me, <CHARNAME>, but I don't think we should, not if you don't mean it.~ [FWKLSYK7]
@2054 = ~I do still want you--I will always want you--but I don't want you to regret making this decision for the wrong reason.~ [FWKLSYK8]
@2055 = ~I understand, I think. Thank you, <CHARNAME>... I think we will both feel even better about it in the morning.~ [FWKLSYK9]
@2056 = ~Forget it, <CHARNAME>. It's over between us. Just... just stay away.~ [FWKLSYMU]

@3002 = ~What was our price, Yoshimo? How sweet was it to sell us?~
@3003 = ~She, if this is a she, is right. I stopped by the circus before this happened, and the gnome was a decent trickster, but not THAT good.~
@3004 = ~Disguise the nice girl as the monster and the monsters as normal people? It's possible, <CHARNAME>, but I can't tell you for sure.~
@3005 = ~Whatever magics were used here are powerful, more than I've seen a simple circus magician ever pull off.~

@3006 = ~You! Hey, you! In the robes!~
@3007 = ~Me?~
@3008 = ~Yeah, you! How'd you like this here genuine landmark sphere? Only 500 gold and it's yours.~
@3009 = ~Wow. Only 500? I could probably come up with that. But what would I do with it?~
@3010 = ~Why, it's perfect for storing whatever you've got to store! Just look at how big it is!~
@3011 = ~But how would I keep my goods safe? This isn't exactly the nicest part of town.~
@3012 = ~Well, hell, look at the thing! It's impervious to almost any form of attack!~
@3013 = ~Fine. Just show me the deed, your Athkatlan general peddling license, your Amnian real estate license, and your Council of Six proof of bond and I'll hand over the money.~
@3014 = ~Oh. Well, I left those in my other pants, son. You give me the money, and I'll come right back.~
@3015 = ~Uh huh. Why don't you stop giving business a bad name, instead?~

@3016=~What he means is that he's not in anything like a legitimate line of business.~
@3017=~<CHARNAME>, there are dozens of merchants in Athkatla who are twice as honest and smell ten times better. Shouldn't we be supporting them instead?~

@3018=~Mmmmm... my dear, I'm glad to see you awake again. I really enjoyed spending the night with you. Thank you for staying with me. It was wonderful. YOU were wonderful. You don't have to show that kind of caring for me to love you, but I am glad we had last night.~ [FWKLSY81]
@3019=~I've been lying here awake, my eyes snapped open a while ago and I couldn't get back to sleep. I've been staring at your arms, and your hair, and--I'm sorry, I'm rambling. If you roll off of my robe, I can be ready to go in just a moment.~ [FWKLSY8A]
@3020=~Sounds good, Kelsey, and yes, I had a good time too. I hope you're game for a rematch soon.~
@3021=~No dice. You're not going anywhere, I'm not finished with you. Come here.~
@3022=~Good idea. You know... I have to say there is some room for improvement.~
@3023=~Awwww. This is hardly a way to treat a lady, you know, shoving her out of bed.~
// @3024 nothing here

@3026=~I love you. And I love that look in your eyes...~
// @3027 nothing here
@3028=~You... you really are wonderful. I hope I showed you everything you mean to me. I do love you.~
@3029=~Come, <CHARNAME>...there will be time enough to discuss this later, but I believe we have important work to do today.~
@3030=~Tonight will be a different story, of course. But I won't assume too much. Let me help you up, my love... I'm sure I remember where we put your top...~
@3031=~I'm not shoving you, silly. I'm just reminding you.~
@3032=~I've been curious what he's been selling over there. All I know is that it occasionally involves people screaming "My eyes!", so...~
@3033=~He's right about the way things used to be, <CHARNAME>. I've been through Trademeet several times over the years and nobody has mentioned a problem. It's been live and let live, as far as I know.~
@3034=~Look at my hands. Do these look like farmer's hands, or castle-owner's hands to you?~
@3035=~Errrr, farmer's hands, definitely.~
@3036=~YOU see that. *I* see that. Why can't THEY see that? My land is zoned as a "castle" and I get this enormous tax bill for mortar and moats and catapults and all of these other crazy things I don't have! I have two rooms, a wife, and three dogs!~
@3037=~Ummm...~
@3038=~But their people say it's a castle! I've more than half a mind to have a coat of arms and a banner made up and I'll get myself my very own serfs! Ho ho!~

// Dec 14 2002 (new flirts)

@3042=~(Stroke Kelsey's face)~
@3043=~(You run your fingertips carefully across his skin, finding special pleasure in his surprisingly smooth skin and the gradual curves of his features.)~
@3044=~(Kelsey doesn't move, but he watches your hand traverse his cheek and jawline as though he more than half-expects you are trying to get something unpleasant off his face, rather than just touching it for fun.)~
@3045=~(When you cradle his cheek in your palm, Kelsey smiles. Seeing as well as feeling his acceptance and his pleasure gives you a warm, satisfied sensation, and Kelsey tentatively reaches out to take your free hand and holds it as you trace small circles in the short, bristly hairs at his temple.)~
@3046=~(Kelsey makes small, almost embarrassed murmurs of pleasure as your fingertips smooth his eyebrows and explore his visage. While not a man whose muscles seem to ripple even in his cheeks, his expression tells your fingers a tale of dedication and trust.)~

@3047=~(Smile at Kelsey)~
@3048=~(Kelsey returns the smile in kind, eyes squinting just slightly as he grins at your attentions.)~
@3049=~(He glances around briefly to make sure you are looking at him, then raises his right hand to chest level and waves, mouthing "Hi" as he does.)~
@3050=~(His beaming eyes meet yours fully, and they tell you of much more than a smile coming back at you.)~

@3051=~(Play with Kelsey's hair)~
@3052=~(That dense red forest that passes for a hairstyle is begging for a disturbance, so you run your fingertips through it, against the grain. It's harder that it looks to get it messy, but you do manage to wear it down to give him something that approximates bangs.)~
@3053=~(Kelsey, who put up only token resistance to this abuse, strains to see the hair now barely hanging in his field of vision. His rolling eyes and mock disapproval don't hide the fact that he's loving the chance to be close.)~
@3054=~(With one swipe of his hand, his hair returns to normal, as though you'd never touched it. A fringe benefit of the sorcery, presumably.)~
@3055=~(Clearly, Kelsey believes that the key to holding his ground in a trade negotiation is a very rigid coif. But it is no match for your playful impulses.)~
@3056=~(Kelsey laughs despite himself as you muss his hair into a charmingly random nest.)~
@3057=~Hey! I spend a good 30 seconds every morning, at least, trying to stop my hair from looking like that!~ [FWKLSYN0]
@3058=~(As you lightly scratch and trace lines through his scalp, Kelsey makes sharp, staccato murmurs of delight.)~
@3059=~(Moving along the edges of his hairline, you stop to slowly rub his attached earlobes, and he tilts his head back slightly and starts taking louder, deeper breaths as you knead between thumb and forefinger.)~
@3060=~(When you've finished, he lets out a long, slow, satisfied sigh and smiles into your eyes, cheeks slightly flushed, as though he wishes you had not stopped touching him.)~

@3061=~(Bump into Kelsey, "accidentally on purpose")~
@3062=~(The hip-check you give Kelsey is anything but subtle. He's not bothered in the slightest, aside from the momentary look of surprise that quickly turns into a sly, hopeful acceptance.)~
@3063=~(He doesn't reciprocate, but his ears are decidedly more pink than they were before you rubbed into him. Mission accomplished.)~
@3064=~(Coming up behind him, you "carelessly" lose sight of where you're walking and plow into him, palm perfectly placed for a gratuitous handful of sorcerer flesh. The bump sends him hopping forward a pace and a half.)~
@3065=~Wha--<CHARNAME>? I don't know how I didn't hear you coming up, or how you didn't see me... (His eyes don't betray whether he's giving you the benefit of the doubt on that one.)~
@3066=~(Kelsey is rummaging through some notes and looks rather distracted, so you stride past him, into his personal space and beyond, pivoting your stride at just the right moment to graze him with chest and thigh as you walk past.)~
@3067=~(His head pops up from the paperwork and swings halfway in your direction, but, lost for words, he literally bites off whatever comment or compliment he was trying to form with a sigh and a pent-up clashing of his teeth.)~
@3068=~(You walk up to him and gently nudge him with your pelvis and kick lightly at his ankles. Kelsey laughs, nervously, at your unexpected physicality.) <CHARNAME>, um, do you need me to walk further away from you? It's not high on my list of things to do, but we shouldn't be tripping over each other.~

@3069=~(Blow in Kelsey's ear)~
@3070=~Aaaaahhhhhhhh! (Kelsey leaps about a foot away from you barely a moment after you begin. He instinctively rubs his ear and looks like he's having second thoughts about overreacting to your advance, but the moment has passed.)~ [FWKLSYN1]
@3071=~(Leaning in close to Kelsey, lips almost brushing his ear, you breathe slow and soft and hot. Tensing slightly and setting his jaw, Kelsey tries to maintain his composure but shudders twice--one massive spasm as you begin, then again, more serenely, as your breath tapers off.)~
@3072=~(You definitely have Kelsey's attention.)~
@3073=~(As you amuse yourself with his tender earlobe, sending him warm, wet air kisses, he reaches out and takes you by the forearm. His grip is firm as he slides his hand up and down, almost unconsciously, kneading as he goes.)~
@3074=~(Just as you think he might make another move, he snaps out of it with a start and releases you, and seems embarrassed by his advance.)~
@3075=~(His grip tightens and he turns to kiss you. You have him so stirred up that there is no prelude to his rapid-fire assault on your face and neck, but it is over quickly when he pulls away.) <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry. I guess I got a little out of control.~

@3076=~(Lean in and finish the kiss)~
@3077=~(You quiet his concerns, and his whole body relaxes into yours, giving you a soft, slow, passionate kiss that seems to carry through more than your lips.)~
@3078=~Why apologize? I like knowing that you pay attention when you should.~
@3079=~There are times when I definitely can't help it, and definitely don't want to.~
@3080=~You're allowed to kiss me when you want to, Kelsey.~
@3081=~(Kelsey is trying to rein in a nervous smile.) And when you deserve it, I hope. I guess I just felt that you deserved it.~
@3082=~Then just sit and be a good boy and keep your hands to yourself until told otherwise.~
@3083=~(Kelsey presses his lips together to avoid smiling and ruining your order.) All right, boss.~

@3084=~(Lean forward and give Kelsey a cleavage shot)~
@3085=~(Noticing that your guard is down, Kelsey almost manages not to look, but you catch him peeking at least four times. It's the tilt of his head that gives it away--he's always returning his head to the same spot inbetween glances.)~
@3086=~(He had been looking into your eyes, but the distraction proves greater than polite conduct and his gaze has clearly been pulled southward.)~
@3087=~(Kelsey is possessed of enough composure and good taste that you can't say he is exactly "eating" you with his eyes, but you are being gently nibbled, at least.)~
@3088=~(After taking a long and longing gaze into the V of your breasts, Kelsey makes a very deliberate effort to turn away, but you hear a slight grunt of frustration as he does so.)~

@3089=~(Playfully elbow Kelsey in the ribs)~
@3090=~(Kelsey elbows you back, just a little less hard than you hit him.)~
@3091=~All right, all right, I'll walk faster. You could just ask, you know. (He grins.)~
@3092=~(He manages to block your blow with his own arm, and it quickly becomes a game, with you foolishly flapping your bent-in arms like wings to try to poke through his equally-ridiculous looking defense, which involves flailing his arms around and contorting in place like a snake.)~

@3093=~Kelsey, you are a sweet, yummy man.~
@3094=~(Kelsey laughs in genuine surprise.) That's really good to hear.~ [FWKLSYN2]
@3095=~Why.. thank you, <CHARNAME>. I think you're pretty splendid yourself.~ [FWKLSYN3]
@3096=~I try. Really.~ [FWKLSYN4]

@3097=~(Look Kelsey over and whistle approvingly)~
@3098=~(Kelsey cracks a smile but seems uncomfortable making eye contact with you. On the whole he looks decidedly self-conscious about your endorsement.)~
@3099=~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. It's the robes, right?~
@3100=~(Kelsey laughs with pride.) That is the nicest thing anybody has said to me all day.~
@3101=~(You suspect that the flush on his cheeks might be his ego threatening to burst out of his head.) I could get used to that, you know.~
@3102=~And if you don't mind me saying so, you look good today as well.~
@3103=~Kelsey, I like you a lot, but let's not flirt like this.~

@3104=~(Nibble your finger seductively at Kelsey)~
@3105=~(Kelsey tries to keep his composure as you roll your fingertip back and forth across your lower teeth, but he appears to be shifting from foot to foot and whimpering slightly.)~
@3106=~(Your teasing inspired Kelsey to retaliate in kind. Slowly and deliberately, so that you will see, he starts rubbing his shoulders one at a time with his opposite hand, making a great show of rolling his head in mock-release.)~
@3107=~(Your antics grabbed Kelsey's attention immediately, but if you had to guess, you would say it was the visible flicking of your tongue that pushed him over the edge.)~
@3108=~(At half a run, Kelsey storms you, puts one arm around your waist, and kisses the side of your neck vigorously, making occasional animal pleasure noises.)~
@3109=~<CHARNAME>, you know I have something else you could... um. Never mind.~ [FWKLSYN5]

@3110=~(Hold Kelsey's hand to your breast)~
@3111=~(As he surreptitiously massages you, Kelsey's grin appears to be in danger of eating his nose.)~
@3112=~I hope I've done something to earn this honor today, <CHARNAME>. I hate being in debt, especially to you. (He kisses you on the cheek.)~
@3113=~<CHARNAME>, if I'm doing this... I'm not concentrating. At all. About anything, except this. (After a slow, loving fondle, he takes his hand back.)~
@3114=~I should really concentrate right now, I think. It's what you pay me for, right? (He tries to stifle a gleeful smirk.)~

@3115=~(Bathe with Kelsey)~
@3116=~<CHARNAME>... if I get you in that tub, I guarantee you we won't leave it today. I would be lying if I said I would really feel GUILTY about that, but I would feel... responsible.~
@3117=~(After hearing your proposition, Kelsey murmurs something you can't quite make out, but the smile, the excited flick of his tongue through his teeth, and the way he leads you on a very brisk pace to the bathing chamber seems positive enough.)~
@3118=~(Outside the chamber, he stops for a brief word and a not-too-subtle coin-passing handshake with the attendant, who scurries off. Kelsey winks at you as you wait.) I got us the good stuff.~
@3119=~(The attendant comes back with a basket in one arm and four fluffy towels in the other, and leads you through the steamy common chamber to a small, partitioned alcove where another attendant is just finishing pouring fresh water.)~
@3120=~(Once the interlopers have made themselves scarce, you help each other out of equipment and clothing. He tosses both your undergarments around the entrance of the partition, presumably to be laundered while you soak. His lean frame is a study in travel-built tautness and his patchy body hair gives you the impression of just a hint of comfortable wear, like a favorite jacket just starting to get soft and comfortable.)~
@3121=~(After running his hands down your sides and kissing your bare shoulders softly, Kelsey sets the basket on a nearby shelf and valiantly offers to test the bath first. The flush the hot water gives his already ruddy features makes him resemble a ripening strawberry.)~
@3122=~(He adds a bit of cool water and bids you enter with him. Using a small pitcher from the basket and a sickly-sweet smelling paste, Kelsey thoroughly washes your hair, humming something tuneless as he sluices the muck of the road from your scalp and hair. It would go faster if he wasn't holding you quite so close, but his midsection presses into your back and you can tell without looking that he is enjoying the vulnerable proximity of your bodies.)~
@3123=~(Going into the basket once more, he comes out with a cake of soap that smells of blueberry hotcakes, and a large rough sponge, which he applies vigorously to your aching back and shoulders. For your more tender areas, Kelsey soaps and hands you a cloth, while he sets to work on himself.)~
@3124=~(Although he appears much more interested in watching you wash, Kelsey is quite thorough and at least as rough with that sponge on himself as he was on you. After he comes up after a quick dunk, you can't help but notice how he almost looks like a different man in this setting... his hair, matted down with water, now looks more brown than anything. Without his clothes, he seems more comfortable, as though stripping away the physical layers between the two of you has eased his mind and made him feel more accepted in your eyes.)~
@3125=~(Looking you both over, Kelsey nods in approval and kisses you from shoulder to hairline by way of reward. He stretches his arms up dramatically, curling his hands behind his head and posing for you with modest triceps flexed in an image silly enough to laugh at, but charming enough not to.)~
@3126=~(He hops out of the tub, tucks a towel around his waist quickly, then takes up two more towels and invites you to step out of the tub. He wraps one around your wet hair, a loose turban, and hands you the other while he ducks around the corner for your now-clean garments. In mock-chastisement for you paying more attention to him bending over for the clothes than drying yourself, he snatches the towel back and rubs you down in a silly, groping, inefficient manner.)~
@3127=~(The basket holds one more treat, a vial of oil Kelsey unstoppers and rubs into his palms before working your back and shoulders. The oil smells lightly of sesame, and heightens the chill now that you are out of the protection of the bathwater. As you don your clothes, Kelsey rubs a bit of the oil into his own chest and shoulders before rejoining you, ready to face the world once more.)~

@3128=~(The bathing chamber is quite crowded and doesn't seem to be clearing out. Rather than sacrifice your modesty, Kelsey has a brief discussion with the innkeeper, asking for a room with a private bathing chamber. A couple of coins cross the counter and a servant takes you to a corner room and sets the water to heat.)~
@3129=~(As you shed your gear, Kelsey removes his robe and bends down to unlace and remove your boots. He would rarely be mistaken for physically powerful, but from this angle, his shoulder and back muscles are remarkably well defined--understated as though they are afraid of attracting too much attention, much like the man himself, but notable all the same. Brushing your fingertips across his shoulder blades confirms their tense, ready strength.)~
@3130=~(The tub is heated and filled, and you both enter, facing each other. Although rather more cramped than you might have hoped for, the way you are almost forced to wrap your legs around Kelsey's neatly narrow hips makes it comfortable enough, and certainly worthwhile. The water and the enameled coating of the tub have you both slipping and sliding in and out of each other's grasp, and the ensuing giggles are doubtless bothering the neighbors.)~
@3131=~(Kelsey produces a fresh cake of soap from somewhere, and amidst much splashing you both manage to get something like clean. Somehow Kelsey--the man is limber, if nothing else--manages to get his legs out from the tangle of your bodies and slings his right leg almost over your shoulder. As you soap up his lower leg, you notice how sculptured and rigid his calf muscles are, doubtless from the hundreds of miles he puts on his feet on the merchant rounds.)~
@3132=~(Still facing you, Kelsey lovingly soaps you just about everywhere he can reach, deftly whisking away the mire of your profession with washcloth and fingernail. Awkwardly balancing on one knee and trying not to slip in the tub or crush you in the process, he kisses you, a slow, soft, wet thing that tastes of the iron and minerals in the water more than the man himself.)~
@3133=~(You both doze off briefly, but the rapidly cooling water is inducement to leave the moment behind--for now. Nothing Kelsey has done for you feels quite so comfortably intimate as when he drapes a second towel across your shoulders, the fibers rough but comforting against your damp skin, his lips on the crown of your head warm and perfect.)~
@3134=~(You lose yourself for a moment, counting all of the places water can drip off of Kelsey's body... chin, hair, fingertips... and of course, the eye-catching trickle running straight down, from his sternum through that rusty nest of hair and beyond. You mouth a special personal curse for the towel he eventually remembers to use to mop it all off.)~
@3135=~(Re-equipped at last, Kelsey gives you a mildly embarrassed shrug after taking a look at the remarkably murky water you have left behind. But that is someone else's problem now. You are re-invigorated to face your own.)~

@3136=~(Kelsey smiles in return with an intrigued twitch of the eyebrows. His forehead is just starting to crease with the years and the miles, and the ripple effect from his eyebrows is quite cute.)~

@3137=~(When you've finished, he lets out a long, slow, satisfied sigh and smiles into your eyes, cheeks flushed. He runs his hand down the side of your face, murmuring appreciation and thanks for your attentions.)~
@3138=~(Kelsey returns the favor, brushing his long, strong fingers along the side of your head, through the same strands of hair.)~
@3139=~(The repeated sensation of his fingertips makes your scalp hyper-sensitive, and you shiver with the strokes. Kelsey warms you with a kiss, letting his hands fall to hold your shoulders and press you near.)~

@3140=~(You almost get away scot-free, but Kelsey grabs you by the belt and pulls you backwards. Kelsey reaches around you and subjects your hips, breasts, and stomach to a brief but brisk interrogation.)~
@3141=~You know, for a heroine, you are a very naughty Bhaalspawn.~ [FWKLSYN6]
@3142=~(Kelsey levels a meaningfully aroused look at you by way of reply.)~

@3143=~Mmmmm. <CHARNAME>, it sounds like fun, but... I'd prefer a time when we didn't have so many things to think about.~

@3144=~(You walk arm in arm to a secluded bank, and the anticipation and the moist air catch in your throat, drawing a concerned look from Kelsey that turns to a smile when you wave him off. A large, flat, reasonably dry rock serves as your impromptu equipment bench.)~
@3145=~(Anticipation has had a more pronounced effect on Kelsey, which you can't help but notice even before he removes the last of his undergarments. With arms also at attention, he taps his hips idly while watching you undress, but seems to think better of ogling you and turns around, and the taut buttocks he keeps hidden in those robes all day flex slowly but deliberately as he strides into the water. As you set your own intimates aside, you hear a startled gasp, and note that Kelsey just submerged at the waist.)~
@3146=~(With cupped hands and gentle splashing, you take turns getting each other clean in nature's way. The chilly water has you both shaking on occasion--Kelsey's sparse, slick, curled body hair is no defense.)~
@3147=~(Kelsey gets a twinkle in his eye, steps back a pace, and begins casting a spell you've heard more than once before. Just as he is about to complete the spell he surprises you by disappearing beneath the water. Through the rippling deception of the waves, you get a marvelous look at a remarkable sight: the sorcerer king of the mermen, hair waving gently in the water's currents, stretches his arms towards you and jets of yellow flame emerge, stopping just short of you.)~
@3148=~(The warm water doesn't hurt. On the contrary, your chilled bones appreciate the respite. As well, the magical combustion creates a strong stream of heated bubbles right underneath you. Kelsey pulls you closer to catch the full force, and the warm assault on your tender skin tickles in a most arousing way. As you start to feel the effects of the bubbles and twist and moan slightly despite yourself, he grins with satisfaction and nips at your ear.)~
@3149=~(You circle one another in the water slowly, lovers in a world all your own, but with Kelsey's lips looking a bit more blue than usual, it seems prudent to get out. He, and his lips, respond quite favorably to your efforts to warm him up once you are back on the shore.)~

@3150=~Sounds like a good idea, <CHARNAME>. (You agree on a spot with enough natural cover to satisfy, and water clear, deep and wide enough to do the job right. Before long, you are both wet and happy, your clothes balled in a heap, your troubles forgotten.)~
@3151=~(Of all the times you have seen Kelsey express his thanks for your company, you feel it more than ever at this very moment. His dark hazel eyes shine so brightly that you think you can actually see the reflection of the water in them, and it seems if you look at the right angle you can see your own reflection... or perhaps, a reflection of what he sees in you.)~
@3152=~(As you talk about nothing in particular and rub away each other's cares in the brisk water, Kelsey reminds you more than once how truly silly an excited man floating on his back looks... rather like a boat whose rudder is mounted on the wrong side.)~
@3153=~(You wade in deeper, until you are both covered in water up to the shouldertops. Kelsey feigns puzzlement as he brushes his fingertips across your nipples, taut and aching slightly with the cold.)~
@3154=~(As he traces curves into your midsection, you regard his shoulders in isolation above the water, noticing the patterns of size and frequency of his freckles. Letting your mind wander, you pick out all sorts of patterns. Atop his left shoulder is your favorite constellation. Atop his more densely freckled right shoulder hides a heart. And running just across to his trapezoidal muscle, you swear you can pick out your first initial.)~
@3155=~(When the fun seems just about over and you both head for shore, Kelsey helps squeeze the excess water from your hair. Some of the water droplets coaxed out by his hands bounce off your hindquarters like a light rain, a rain conjured by your lover solely to caress you with tiny fingertaps.)~
@3156=~(Kelsey starts to pick through his clothes while you work through your own, but stark naked himself and with your breasts still bared to the world he stops you, holds you just right by the hips, and looks deep into your eyes.) I love sharing the outdoors with you, <CHARNAME>. I love that we have more to share with each other than just what we own. That's really special to me.~
@3157=~Aaaaahhhhhhhh! (Kelsey leaps about a foot away from you barely a moment after you begin, then laughs at his own overreaction.)~ [FWKLSYN1]
@3158=~(He holds you close, encouraging you to nibble and tug at his ear with long sighs of approval.)~

@3159=~(Kelsey unapologetically stares at as much as you're willing to show him.)~
@3160=~(He drinks in the view greedily, but looks up into your eyes with a hint of suspicion.) This is some sort of test, isn't it? To see if I will pay attention and follow your orders, faced with your--distractions.~ [FWKLSYN7]
@3161=~If it were anyone else, I'm sure I wouldn't be failing so badly. (He glances downward once more before tearing his head away, trying to act like he has scored some sort of victory for good taste and discipline. You know better.)~
@3162=~(Few things are as silly as Kelsey flexing his biceps at you. You know this, because now you've seen it.)~
@3163=~Kelsey, I love you very much, but please stop flirting with me.~
@3164=~(It looks like Kelsey has his mind on you, not your marching orders.)~ [FWKLSYMU]
@3165=~(Kelsey gives you a short, friendly kiss on the cheek. He seems to be trying too hard to be sure of keeping his hands clear of your body.) You look like you need those more often than you get them, <CHARNAME>.~
@3166=~(Realizing he has been discovered, Kelsey tries to pretend he was doing something else. He toys briefly with his decorative amulet, holding it out and letting it fall to his chest a few times in a row.)~
@3167=~(Kelsey shoots a smile at you--more with his eyes than his lips.)~
@3168=~Don't be afraid to tell me if you need something, <CHARNAME>. I know you have a lot on your mind, so I would like to help.~
@3169=~(In fact, Kelsey's attention seems to be totally occupied by your behind. He looks slightly disappointed that you have turned to him and taken it out of view, but tries to casually pretend that he was looking at something else on the ground. You are not fooled.)~

@3170=~You know, I think this was just what I needed. A chance to do something meaningful, for someone who really matters.~
@3171=~<CHARNAME>, I enjoy working with you, truly, but I think maybe we should try to be a little more considerate to others.~

@3172=~(Kelsey takes your free hand in his left, and starts tracing circles atop your knuckles with his right. His touch is gentle and soft, and sends tiny tingles up your arm.)~

@3173=~Your hair is really quite nice. Oh, wait a second--~ [FWKLSYN8]
@3174=~(Boldly, Kelsey reaches out and fixes a stray strand of hair at your temple. He rather sneakily runs his fingertips down the edge of your ear as he tucks the lock in place, and he tries but fails to suppress a shiver of pleasure.)~
@3175=~(He rests his fingertips against your earlobe and drinks in your image just for a second before he lets his hand fall from your face.)~

@3176=~I hope we meet someone I know in town. That is, I'd like you to meet more of the people I know. It's not all just Cowled Wizards and Shadow Thieves in Amn, there really are some good folk.~ [FWKLSYN9]
@3177=~<CHARNAME>, I know you're going to think this is crazy, but I just remembered this strange dream I had. I was in a forest just like this one, and there was a dryad who looked just like you, and we... um. Never mind.~ [FWKLSYNA]

@3178=~(Kelsey looks as though he's about to say something, but he ends up yawning instead, stretching his lean arms over his head and rolling his hazel eyes back in an adorably uncontrollable manner.)~
@3179=~(With a slight shrug, he smiles briefly and turns away, looking rather sheepish about the sudden attack of sleepiness.)~

@3180=~(Sensing that you notice him, Kelsey makes direct eye contact and takes a deep breath.)~
@3181=~<CHARNAME>, I... mmmm, never mind.~

@3182=~(Kelsey looks over your wounds and the color drains from his face. He strides over quickly and puts arm around your shoulders.) <CHARNAME>, do you need me to get you to a healer? I hate seeing you hurt like this.~ [FWKLSYNB]

@3183=~Thank you for taking time for me, <CHARNAME>. It's really good to have someone I like to talk to around, day or night.~ [FWKLSYNC]
@3184=~(He is scribbling in a small book... you might have assumed it was some sort of ledger, but his constant glances at you, followed by bursts of writing, lead to you conclude it is YOU he is taking account of.)~
@3185=~(When he notices that you are on to him, he hastily stuffs the book into an inner pocket of his robe and tries to look busy with something else.)~

@3186=~Oh! Before I forget and it gets all over the place, I picked up a block of honeycomb the last time we were through town. Want a bite? Help me finish it, it's almost gone.~ [FWKLSYND]
@3187=~No thanks, not my thing.~
@3188=~(Break off a piece and eat it)~
@3189=~(Bite a chunk off of the offered comb)~
@3190=~All right. I just thought you might like a treat. (Kelsey polishes off the chunk of honeycomb himself in two bites. Sticky sweetness glints at the corner of his mouth for a minute before he wipes it away.)~
@3191=~(Kelsey doesn't take his eyes off your lips for a second as your half of the honeycomb goes from his hand to your hand to your mouth.)~
@3192=~(Kelsey smiles at your eagerness, and chuckles as you wipe the excess honey from your lower lip.)~
@3193=~(The honey is smooth and sweet against your tongue, and the slightly chewy counterpoint of the comb just makes the flavor last that much longer.)~
@3194=~There's cane, there's molasses, there's cubes... but nothing in the world is quite as sweet as honey. I hope you like it. (Kelsey pops the remaining portion in his mouth.)~
@3195=~It was fine, but why don't you get me things more often? Hmmmm?~
@3196=~Mmmm. Delicious. Thank you, Kelsey.~
@3197=~That was delicious, Kelsey, but it looks like I missed some... (Greedily lick the rest of the honey off Kelsey's finger)~
@3198=~I... I'll try, <CHARNAME>. I didn't realize there was a problem.~
@3199=~Any time, <CHARNAME>.~
@3200=~(Kelsey laughs in surprise as you lick his digit clean.) Mmmmm... perhaps I should get more next time?~
@3201=~(He approaches from your left flank, and stands very near, making a show of inspecting the surroundings but spending at least as much time darting his eyes at you.)~
@3202=~If you're taking suggestions, <CHARNAME>... why don't we head in that direction? (He indicates with his right arm, which brushes against your left as he tries to get you to follow where he is pointing. You feel the heat of his quickening breath and you could swear he's trying to smell your hair.)~

@3203=~(Kelsey smiles warmly as he approaches you.)~ [FWKLSYMU]

@3204=~(Kelsey takes your right hand and noisily kisses the combat-tempered callus on the heel of your palm.) Soon, my love, we will be able to be safe without all the fighting.~

@3205=~You know, I've been thinking of something I've heard that reminds me of you... of us...~ [FWKLSYNE]

@3206=~Maybe I'll just sing awhile
And then pay you a call
Maybe I'll just say hello
And say maybe that's all~ [FWKLSYNF]
@3207=~Hurry home as love is true
Will help us through the night
Till we're coming home again
Our life seems like, life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight~ [FWKLSYNG]

@3208=~I... I don't normally sing like that, or ever, really, but I just can't get that lyric out of my head.~

@3209=~(He gives you a quick, impulsive kiss. Nothing epic, just a kiss.)~
@3210=~(He stands next to you and holds your hand.) No matter how dark things get, my love, I will always believe in you.~ [FWKLSYNJ]

@3211=~(He is scanning you again, and making notes in that journal of his. Seeing your interest, he looks up from his writing.) Don't worry, it's nothing bad, <CHARNAME>. I just like keeping an account of what we do together. I don't want to lose sight of the details.~

@3212=~(Kelsey unscrews a small amber jar, and a deliciously sweet wave assaults you.) Want to try this honey, <CHARNAME>? It's mixed with lavender. I haven't tried it yet, but you can be the first.~

@3213=~I really don't like the stuff. I hate insects. Bees. Yuck.~
@3214=~Well, I wouldn't want to live with them, but they make good honey. I'll just have to eat enough for both of us, I guess.~
@3215=~Sure, I'm game. We already know you have good taste.~
@3216=~You try it first, and let me know if it's any good. I wouldn't want to deprive you of the first bite.~
@3217=~(Kelsey gathers a healthy glob on his pinky finger and places it against your lips without losing a drip in the transfer. To get at the honey--and to avoid a mess--you admit his fingertip, and the sweetness explodes against your tastebuds almost as soon as you do. Kelsey has an eye for excellent honey, and having it fed to you, being waited on, makes it all the more delectable.)~
@3218=~(Kelsey dabs his pinky finger in the jar, flicks his tongue at the glistening trail of honey, and dramatically smacks his lips at you.)~
@3219=~Yes. Yes, I promise you that it is. Now, your turn?~
@3220=~Let me at it, Kelsey.~
@3221=~Nah, never mind.~
@3222=~(Kelsey doesn't give you a chance to ponder the experience, however. He decides to sample it from your lips, giving you tiny tasting kisses across the length of your mouth while you try to swallow the honey.)~
@3223=~Sorry. What can I say? I love my honey.~ [FWKLSYNH]

@3224=~(He reaches up and touches your cheek gently, then tilts your head in to meet his lips fully, richly.)~
@3225=~(The embrace is soft and slow at first, but he wastes little time in quickening the pace, and insisting more and more often that you make room for his tongue to meet yours. Keeping up with the bobbing of his head isn't exactly easy, either.)~
@3226=~(Before things get too messy, the liplock is broken and both of you are left panting from the exertion and mutual suffocation.)~
@3227=~Pfah. That you stand for this weakling slobbering all over you... disgusting.~
@3228=~Perhaps someone else should take the point? I say again, <CHARNAME>, perhaps someone else should take the point? To watch for threats?~
@3229=~Aye, careful there lass, he may look a sissy but he may eat yer head if I be readin' him right! And watch that forked tongue!~
@3230=~It was said among my peers that one could never tire of studying nature's mating rituals. That theory is being challenged right now.~
@3231=~O-oh... can't you two wait until you're alone, or something?~
@3232=~Nope, no really important quests here, everybody stop what you're doing! Stop the world! <CHARNAME> and Kelsey need to get in some quality necking!~
@3233=~Sorry... I just got carried away. (The grin he is trying to hide between deep breaths, and the look of flushed, smug satisfaction on his face tells you he really isn't.)~

@3234=~(He maneuvers behind you and starts to rub your shoulders lightly... more a reassuring touch than anything truly therapeutic, but it works just the same.)~
@3235=~(As he kneads, Kelsey blows gently at the stray wisps of hair that curl down the back of your neck, breath cool and crisp, and you feel goosebumps rising which he then blows on, making the sensation all the more vivid.)~
@3236=~Am I distracting you? (He pokes his head around your shoulder to kiss you briefly on the cheek before resuming his place in line.)~


@3237=~(Without a word, he reaches out and takes you in his arms, holding you close and kissing your neck in reassurance.)~
@3238=~(His scent is a blend of cut apple and fresh parchment, and just a little reminiscent of the air after a lightning strike. He murmurs into your ear, voice catching slightly with the moment.) Things really will work out, <CHARNAME>. For you, and for both of us.~
@3239=~I hope so, my love.~
@3240=~How can you possibly be so sure? So many are lined up to defy us! So many who hate us, would kill us... will kill us!~
@3241=~I never doubted it, Kelsey. Not since you came into my life.~
@3242=~Of course we will. I rule, and you're not half-bad yourself.~
@3243=~It will. (He turns to give you a long, unnecessarily loud kiss on the right cheek before releasing you from the embrace.)~
@3244=~(Taken aback by your panic, Kelsey tightens his grip around your back with his left arm and begins slowly stroking your hair with his right hand, soothing your nerves.) Shhhh... <CHARNAME>, I can't prove it to you in advance, but I know that we have each other, and we have already survived so much. Trust in yourself, trust in us, and everything will be fine.~
@3245=~Good! Then that spell I put on you is working.~
@3246=~Kidding.~
@3247=~I could get used to such big compliments, boss. (He grins, reaches down to squeeze your behind sharply, and dutifully returns to position.)~

@3248=~(Kelsey takes your free hand and holds it in both of his, pressing firmly and warmly. Noticing that his are smaller than yours brings a smile to your lips, but he doesn't seem to mind.)~
@3249=~(Kelsey takes your free hand and holds it in his right, and his fingers tenderly twine around yours.)~
@3250=~(You note the very light carpet of ruddy hairs that cover the backs of his hands and fingers... hands that are rougher with hard, bloody work than when you first met him, of that you have no doubt. The light touch of your breath seems to make the fur dance.)~

@3251=~(Kelsey takes you by the hand and pulls your arm out towards him, running the long, thin fingers of his free hand along the length, from fingertip to shoulder, making just the barest contact as he traces spirals on your skin.)~
@3252=~(With each of your numerous, involuntary shivers, Kelsey smiles wider and wider, and actually starts making small little satisfied grunts in time with your tremors of pleasure.)~

@3253=~(With a friendly smile, Kelsey sidles behind you and slips an arm around your stomach, pulling you close against him and burying his face against your shoulder blade.)~

@3254=~(In a scene not likely to make any courtly guides, Kelsey takes you by the hand, kisses it in the traditional manner, and then takes a playful bite at your wrist.)~

@3255=~Thank you for going through so much for me. I am glad you didn't leave me for Bodhi... I don't want to think about what more that could have done to me.~

@3256=~I love--YOU. (The ensuing firm thrust of his pelvis into your thigh gives you a good idea of exactly where he loves you at the moment.)~
@3257=~I love you, <CHARNAME>. I know that you could have any man you wanted. Thank you for... for choosing me.~ [FWKLSYNK]

@3258=~(Kelsey breezes by you and slips something into your pocket, deftly but clearly intended to be noticed. Reaching in, you discover a small slip of paper that wasn't there before.)~
@3259=~(You unfold it and read it. It starts out reading like an expedition outfitting list but then there are some decidedly unusual items, such as "20 yellow roses" and "a foot massage.")~
@3260=~(Then there is a whole string of short entries listed in languages you're not familiar with... until you reach the bottom of the list when you start recognizing some of the more common tongues of the region. Kelsey has written "I love you" in as many languages as he can think of.)~

@3261=~<CHARNAME>... do we have a little time to relax? I'd like to spend some special time alone, if we can.~ [FWKLSYNI]
@3262=~Not now, Kelsey.~
@3263=~Time alone? Me and you? Lead the way!~
@3264=~All right. Some other time, then. (His eyes reflect disappointment, but not crushing despair.)~

@3265=~(Kelsey has a few words with the innkeeper, then leads you to a secluded room, away from the noisy, smoky crowds.)~
@3266=~Trust me, please, <CHARNAME>. (Kelsey relieves you of your equipment, and then removes your clothes with dispatch, placing them in a small pile near the door, well out of your reach.)~
@3267=~(He lays you on the bed, on your stomach, head turned to the wall, and asks you to stay put. You hear the distinctive sounds of your sorcerer disrobing, and the slight whistle of said robe and, presumably, other garments flying across the room and landing in a new pile.) Be a good girl, and don't move.~
@3268=~(Kelsey walks slowly towards the bed and massages your feet, slowly and firmly, working at least 3 miles of wear from them. He then starts stroking the backs of your legs, running his fingertips with amazingly steady pressure from your calves to the base of your rear. The effect is almost calming--your body is sending conflicted signals for both sleep and arousal.)~
@3269=~(Now resting a knee on the bed, he leans in to kiss the backs of your thighs as he starts kneading your bottom, working in large circles out to your hips which he lovingly gropes before moving inward once more.)~
@3270=~(He climbs atop the bed and straddles you to massage your back, and you feel him press into the cleft of your buttocks as his hands mercilessly but exquisitely assault the tight muscle groups around each of your vertebrae, and grind at your shoulders... it is as though Kelsey is actually furious at your sore muscles for inconveniencing you. They yield to him, releasing and dispelling aches you have had so long they were almost forgotten.)~
@3271=~(Finally, satisfied with your loosened back, he dismounts and rolls you over, and you can see him fully. The light, ruddy carpet that forms a small cross on his chest is beginning to glint with the sweat from his exertions on your body. His manhood stands at full attention, and despite yourself your breath catches slightly when he leans in--but it is not to take you.)~
@3272=~(He begins at your hairline, scraping gently with his fingernails through your scalp and around your ears, leaving an electric tingle with each stroke. Kelsey moves to tracing your cheekbones inward. Kelsey's eyes are slits, his breath is quickened... you are not quite sure if he is lover or craftsman right now.)~
@3273=~(As he reaches your collarbone, he stops and kisses you once on the lips--a wet, sweet symbol of love. After a course down and up each arm, and then down your sides, his splayed fingers, now quite warm and growing slick with your sweat, trace across your breasts and midsection, leaving no square inch untouched.~
@3274=~(From here, Kelsey runs his hands firmly down your stomach and thighs, fingers creeping but never fully reaching inward, but the transition of his touch from your belly to your inner thighs gives you a jolt each time he does it.)~
@3275=~(Sensation explodes inside your mind in a most unusual way... no one thing, but the culmination of it all brought it about, and you feel as though you have been plunged into colorful warm water.)~
@3276=~(Virtually anything would seem like a good idea at this moment. Kelsey climbs atop the bed once more, and in three-point stance runs his left hand your toes to your nose by a very direct route. He kisses you again, more firmly and deeply this time, pressing himself into your side, and you feel his pulse beating into your hip.)~
@3277=~(You lie there for a moment, wondering what Kelsey might have in mind for a finisher or encore, but he gets up and starts to dress.) We should probably get back... I don't know how much time you set aside.~
@3278=~I don't understand... don't you want your reward?~
@3279=~We're leaving this room over my dead body. Get back in this bed!~
@3280=~That was beautiful, Kelsey. Thank you very very much... you'll have to show me how I can do that for you some time.~
@3281=~All those lovely, lovely sounds you made were my reward, my love. (He starts playfully tossing your clothes at you, over his shoulder, which has the delightful side effect of giving you an excellent shot of the behind he hides inside those robes all day.)~
@3282=~(Without missing a beat, Kelsey drops the shirt he was shaking out, and makes it into the bed and your loving arms in one amazingly energetic bound, which offers a lot of promise for the events to come...)~
@3283=~You're welcome, <CHARNAME>. I have no idea what I just did, though. (Rarely does Kelsey look dangerously roguish, but his impish smile hits you at just the right angle...)~

// Back to interjections, Dec 15 02

@3300=~I have heard of Pimlico. In fact, we were supposed to meet just the other day about his collection, but he sent word and called it off. I still haven't actually met him.~
@3301=~Yes, in a property squabble between itinerant actors and a renegade sewer-dwelling mage, I agree. The authorities would probably throw up their hands in indifference.~

@3302=~That is how the Cowled Wizards like it, isn't it? Don't act, don't think unless ordered to?~
@3303=~Calm yourself, fool. If the matter truly gets out of hand I am sure someone will do something. A few peasants turning up dead is hardly justification to interrupt my research.~
@3304=~They must be pretty desperate if they are dealing with Drow and involving a dragon. Or has Irenicus been in league with the Drow all along?~

@3305=~This is... uncomfortable.~
@3306=~Quit yer moanin'! Ye wouldn't know a Drow from a day-lily, ye worthless sap! I've gutted 'em by the score, and I'm burnin' inside this blasted illusion!~
@3307=~We must try to make the best of things, Kelsey. You might like the way you look with white hair.~
@3308=~That isn't helping, Nalia.~



// New material, 9-7-03, for release 2.0

@3310=~I learned quickly and painfully that getting older hardly solves any of life's problems.~
@3311=~Maybe that has something to do with you trying too hard to be liked.~
@3312=~Oh, I know that time doesn't heal all wounds, <CHARNAME>.~
@3313=~You can never introduce yourself to too many people.~
@3314=~But I think I know what you mean. I suppose some of the best friends I have met have come to me when I wasn't necessarily looking. Like Bryan Linn.~
@3315=~I respect people who keep their priorities straight.~
@3316=~Relax, Kelsey. You are among friends now.~
@3317=~Yes, there is value in being dedicated to one's career, but too much time around soldiers-for-hire gets to be depressing. There are only so many times I can hear people gloating over beating someone's brains in with their boot.~
@3318=~Of course, it's not always like that... including being with you, of course.~
@3319=~That... that means a lot to me to hear from you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@3320=~You know, all this makes me think about my old friend Bryan Linn, whom I met a few years ago.~
@3321=~Kelsey, this is not my favorite subject. I am already annoyed that we are discussing it at all. Please do not annoy me further or you will see exactly what it's like.~
@3322=~Why, it has always felt like second nature to me. I am not only grateful for the talents of my heritage, but very worthy.~
@3323=~I know. I know I should not have pressed, <CHARNAME>, but sometimes my mind races when I think I have made a discovery. I hope you can forgive the intrusion.~
@3324=~Really? I am surprised, but I envy you. I wish I could say it has been as easy for me.~
// TRANS: @3325 is similar to @398
@3325=~To be honest, my powers still scare me. When I was younger, I used to hope that it would fade as I got older, or if I just cast one more magic missile at a tree I could use up all the power for good and it would never come back.~
@3326=~It does not help that I hardly ever see you smile, Kelsey. Smile! You're depressing me!~
@3327=~So... stop giving me that impression, then. Do you even enjoy what you do?~
@3328=~I will! I mean, smile, not depress you.~
@3329=~I don't think anyone has asked me that before. But yes. Yes, I do. I just take the good parts for granted sometimes. Like meeting new people, and helping them in ways they could not have imagined when they first met...~
@3330=~...but, yes. Even the parts of my life that haven't involved meeting you, have been worth living as a trader.~
@3331=~That sounds brilliant! Can I have one? I'd love to try it.~
@3332=~If they are so perfect, why don't you use one?~
@3333=~Sorry, I wasn't carrying them with me this time... but I'm getting ahead of myself.~
@3334=~I did for a time, but every time I did he would expect me to hit every target I picked and got very cross when I didn't... but I'm getting ahead of myself.~
@3335=~Some things are better left a mystery, Kelsey. Avenging Gorion brought me little peace.~
@3336=~You have the whole of your life ahead of you. Bravo, for both of us. Let's not worry so much about the past.~
@3337=~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I try not to obsess, I truly do, but for your sake I will keep my thoughts of Birinar and my mother to myself.~
@3338=~I see your point. But I would like the chance to know, to close the books on my father's life. It seems I cannot let it go, and I cannot answer the important questions, either.~
@3339=~I know that just two months after I began casting, he was struck with a terrible weakness and could barely get out of bed. Within a week, he had wasted and died.~
@3340=~You are no fool, Kelsey. No more than I would have been if I had brushed you off when you ran up and asked to join me. I will never forget how eager you were.~
@3341=~Thank you, Kelsey. You have been the bright spot of some of my darkest days, too.~
@3342=~Did I really show my excitement? I suppose I was eager, as you say. But when I first saw you, you looked so alive, so vibrant... so different from anyone else I had ever met. I HAD to know you. And I am so glad I do.~
@3343=~No, <CHARNAME>, thank you. I knew I wanted to meet you and get to know you, but I never imagined that it would be this rewarding.~
@3344=~You will be, Kelsey. We were made for each other, forever.~
@3345=~Oh yeah? Then you had better shape up a bit! Suck in that gut! Stop slouching! Drop and give me twenty! I want my man to look like a MAN!~
@3346=~I believe that more and more each day, <CHARNAME>. And I have a harder and harder time imagining what my life would be like without you in it.~
@3347=~I--all right, <CHARNAME>. All right. I will try to be more of what you want, if that will make you happier.~
@3348=~What else do I know, Kelsey? I don't want to be a cloistered monk. So I choose that which I know second-best, this damnable, inescapable, bloody wandering!~
@3349=~Make me a better offer, then, my sweet salesman.~
@3350=~There is more to life, <CHARNAME>. And I know what it can be.~
@3351=~I know times are bad, <CHARNAME>, but this cannot go on forever. We WILL defeat Irenicus, and then you will have your whole life ahead of you.~
@3352=~I would never doubt your ability as a leader, <CHARNAME>, but I have seen too many bad things happen to good people to believe that this life would be safe for you forever.~
@3353=~I am certainly going to try.~
@3354=~You sound uneasy, Kelsey. Are you all right?~
@3355=~Of course. Damn, I'm tired. Help me get my things off, will you?~
@3356=~Yes! Yes, I'm fine, <CHARNAME>. I just have something to say to you. To ask.~
@3357=~Ah! It's... it's funny you should ask, <CHARNAME>. I--that is--~
@3358=~Let me start again.~
@3359=~Good. Because there's nowhere you can run that I won't make you mine.~
@3360=~I'm glad. You complete me, Kelsey love, and I want you forever at my side.~
@3361=~I promise never to run, <CHARNAME>, if you promise always to chase me like that. You make it tempting for me to find out what would happen!~
@3362=~I will be here for you, my love. For as much and as long as you need me, and hopefully more.~
@3363=~I feel the same... you put it so well.~
@3364=~No matter what we face together, <CHARNAME>, I won't leave you. I don't ever want what we have built together to be broken.~
@3365=~Thank you for... for making all of this possible, and for believing in me.~

@3367=~<CHARNAME>, I don't think Imoen is in any condition to get out of here without our help!~
@3368=~<CHARNAME>, did you not hear Imoen? She needs our help! We can't just turn our backs on her!~
@3369=~Oh.~
@3370=~Coltrane.~
@3371=~Barterman.~
@3372=~Still in town?~
@3373=~Yes, obviously.~
@3374=~I would have thought you would be heading back north by now.~
@3375=~I might have. But I'm travelling with <CHARNAME> now.~
@3377=~Is that all right?~
@3378=~Yes, fine. You know all are as welcome as a doormat here at the Adventurer's Mart.~
@3379=~Good. I'm sure that when <PRO_HESHE> needs something, <PRO_HESHE> will be glad to know that.~
@3380=~Wow, you know THE Ribald Barterman?~
@3381=~What was that about? Looks like you two are not happy to see one another.~
@3382=~So can you get me a discount with this guy, or what?~
@3383=~We're business acquaintances, nothing more. Ribald will sell to anybody at his counter but he's very picky about who he deals with behind the scenes. I'm amazed Lady Yuth ever talked him into allowing her that space in the back.~
@3384=~It is a long story, <CHARNAME>. Each of us blames the other for a deal that didn't happen. But it is only business, it will not affect how he treats you, I trust.~
@3385=~I wish I could, but I doubt it. Ribald and I are not exactly friends, as you may have gathered.~

@3386=~Now, wait just a minute. I AM standing right here.~
@3387=~I cannot tell you how much better I feel to be back on the surface, breathing real air, seeing your face instead of Veldrin's...~
@3388=~I have a whole new appreciation for both. Fresh air, and your face, that is.~

@3389=~This used to be my favorite part of Athkatla. It's a guilty pleasure, watching all sorts of people scurry from one side of town to the other.~
@3390=~But things aren't really what they used to be. I don't know what changed it, I wasn't here to watch it happen, but now the scurrying is a lot faster, and they are not so much trying to get TO somewhere else as AWAY from here.~
@3391=~It is not as bad as the thief-infested docks, but still. It's a shame. I hope the Council finds out why the dregs keep filtering over here, and puts a stop to it. The fishmarkets are a joke and trade is almost dead.~

@3392=~<CHARNAME>, I don't approve of the way you have been treating the merchants trying to do business with us.~
@3393=~These are good people, many of them my colleagues and quite a few of them my friends. I don't appreciate you stealing from them. I need it to stop.~
@3394=~You make me laugh.~
@3395=~But, Kelsey, I need those items much more than they do! We are on a mission!~
@3396=~I cannot help myself. I see all those shiny weapons and beautiful suits of armor... I just cannot walk away!~
@3397=~Get out of my sight. I don't need you pretending to be my mother.~
@3398=~All right, Kelsey. Out of respect for your profession, I will try to behave.~
@3399=~I don't think it's funny. And I won't just stand here while you continue to hurt these people.~
@3400=~Yes, but we don't have to lower ourselves to stealing from honest merchants to do what needs to be done. I hope this stops.~
@3401=~I don't know what to say about that, <CHARNAME>. I think you know exactly what you're doing. And I hope it stops.~
@3402=~I was just leaving, in fact. I don't want any part of you.~
@3403=~Don't say that, <CHARNAME>, please. I know what we're doing is important, but I don't want to harm decent people caught in the middle.~
@3404=~Thank you. I know what it's like to be tempted, but really, these people deserve to be treated fairly. That's all they ask of us.~
@3405=~You still don't understand. These people you steal from do not deserve being treated like dirt. But all you see is a chance to take, instead of to treat them fairly.~
@3406=~I can't just stand by while you trample all over people just to have your way.~
@3407=~Oh, you can't? And just what are you going to do about it?~
@3408=~Damn you, Kelsey, don't you understand that there's a greater good here? One missing trinket does not bankrupt anybody!~
@3409=~Kelsey, I swear, I will make it up to everyone. Keep a ledger for me of everything I have taken, and I promise to repay them with interest once I have put an end to Irenicus.~
@3410=~You are going to sound funny when I knock the teeth from your mouth.~
@3411=~I thought you love me for who I am! But all you can do is complain about me!~
@3412=~I am going to take my services elsewhere, <CHARNAME>. I hope we never meet again.~
@3413=~But this isn't just one trinket here or there. This is a pattern. This is the way you want to be. And I want no part of it.~
@3414=~You would say something like that, <CHARNAME>. Do you really think it's that easy?~
@3415=~But... I believe you are sincere. And I don't agree with your methods but I can live with that arrangement. Thank you for... trying, at least.~
@3416=~If you were that worried about it, you would have asked me to do so long ago, rather than wait until now. I think you are lying. And I think I am leaving.~
@3417=~I had hoped this conversation would not end with my leaving. That was a foolish hope.~
@3418=~I wonder if there was anything I could have done to help Ceara.~ [FWKLSYP0]
@3419=~I don't mean helping her with whatever she wanted a sorcerer for, I mean with her mind. To get her healing. Or something. I don't know.~
@3420=~Be honest with me, Kelsey. Was there something going on between you two, and she was just unhappy to see me?~
@3421=~I doubt there was anything anyone could have done. She seemed pretty far gone.~
@3422=~She hardly left us any choice.~
@3423=~We all have these little regrets, Kelsey. Maybe I could have helped Sarevok before he did what he did. But we survived, and that is what counts.~
@3424=~Didn't you try?~
@3425=~No, nothing of the sort. I think she may have implied that there would be an... well, an opportunity to get physical, that time we met, but as you can imagine from having seen her, she did not set my mind at ease.~
@3426=~I wasn't comfortable with her, and I told her so. She just said that she would not be ignored so easily, and that she would have what she wanted from me in time. But how could I take that seriously? How could I expect...?~
@3427=~I don't know. She seemed intelligent and resourceful, and we certainly saw that she had considerable powers. But something was clearly wrong with her, and I wish that she hadn't become so obsessed with me to the point that we had to kill her!~
@3428=~You feel responsible for her death, don't you? It wasn't your fault. You did nothing wrong, nothing to warrant her attack.~
@3429=~I agree with you, she could have made a powerful ally. Perhaps I made the wrong decision, siding with you over her.~
@3430=~Well, not ALL women with a special interest in sorcerers are like Ceara. Remember that, for my sake, or I shall be very lonely.~
@3431=~I saw potential for her as well. It is a shame, but we must move on.~
@3432=~Bah. She was nutty as a fruitcake, and she is out of her misery now.~
@3433=~I believe you are right. At least, certainly, there was nothing we could have done when she attacked to change her mind. But before... I am not so sure. Maybe if I had been more interested in her problems, instead of just trying to get away.~
@3434=~I suppose it is a similar situation, but that doesn't make it easier. I feel like I should have known better when I met her, and said something or done something differently.~
@3435=~She was power-mad and met a fitting end when she trifled with the wrong people. It's simple. Stop thinking about it.~
@3436=~I don't think so, no. I was so disturbed by her manner I was thinking about my own problems, not hers.~
@3437=~I do, yes. And it's not the same as I feel when we are attacked by bandits, or most anyone else. Because it was personal. She wanted me, for whatever she wanted for, and... and she had to die because of that.~
@3438=~I don't know why I feel that reflects poorly on me, but I do. I will, for a while, too.~
@3439=~...and a fine day to you as well. I will remember that.~
@3440=~That means so much to hear right now, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. But I never would have considered Ceara representative of you at all.~
@3441=~Let us continue on. I think I am feeling better.~
@3442=~There are just too many people who will not live and let live in this world, <CHARNAME>. I wish it was not too much to ask of them.~
@3443=~I wish I could see it in such simple terms, but it was me she was... calling out for. And it's given me more to think about than I want.~
@3444=~Valygar, you choose to live here? I wouldn't have thought you and the locals would get along very well.~ [FWKLSYP1]
@3445=~The docks weren't always like this. That estate has been in my family for generations. I see no reason to abandon it to thieves simply because they are here.~
@3446=~Oh. So things were different while you were growing up, is that what you're saying?~
@3447=~Yes.~
@3448=~Can you, uh, be more specific? I've never seen it as anything other than what it is today, the center of Shadow Thief activity.~
@3449=~No. My family moved around at the whim of my mother and whatever disgusting ritual she was compelled to research. I was never overlong in the docks, or anywhere else.~
@3450=~So, there were other places.~
@3451=~Yes.~
@3452=~...Such as?~
@3453=~I was always most fond of our cabin in the Umar Hills.~
@3454=~Where you went to hide from the Cowled Wizards.~
@3455=~Yes.~
@3456=~Oh... Well... uh, all that time there probably helps explain your decision to become a ranger.~
@3457=~Probably.~
@3458=~Ah.~
@3459=~Well.~
@3460=~That's all, I suppose.~
@3461=~Good.~

@3462=~My dear, before you sleep, I would like to talk to you for a moment.~ [FWKLSYP2]
@3463=~I was terse with you after you saved me from Bodhi. I did not mean to be, but it was very hard to think about anything but how glad I was to see your face, and to be free from Bodhi.~
@3464=~I think part of the problem was that at first I didn't believe that it was real, or that you were real. To... to turn me, Bodhi showed me some awful visions and illusions. You were in a lot of them, and you were not exactly friendly.~
@3465=~When I saw you again, I wanted to believe it was you, I truly did, but I also didn't want to give Bodhi any more ammunition to use against me.~
@3466=~What was it like, then? How could she make you turn against me?~
@3467=~Were you true to me, Kelsey? Did you make love to that creature?~
@3468=~You don't have to tell me about it. It is enough for me that she is destroyed and we are together again.~
@3469=~I would have traded places with you if I could have.~
@3470=~I still wish you had ducked.~
@3471=~It wasn't like anything I have ever experienced. I know what magical illusions are, and I have certainly suffered the effects of spells. But when she bit me, I felt something wrong start to twist my mind.~
@3472=~She was in there, telling me that she loved me, and that I loved her, and that everything I had ever known in my life was irrelevant because I had a new life now as her servant. And whatever she did to me, whatever powers she had, made my body obey her. I could see, and I could think, but I was not really in control.~
@3473=~I knew it was wrong, and she could tell that I resisted. It had something to do with not being able to complete my transformation, I gather, which is why you were able to save me.~
@3474=~So she pushed me harder. She made me see things that... that I can't even describe. They were black, and crawling, and horrible. I think... I think she may have been showing me her soul, or whatever was left of it.~
@3475=~And it told me lies. So many lies that I didn't know what was true anymore. I didn't really know my name when you found us, I don't think. I just knew that you were both talking about me.~
@3476=~And that is what happened. And it is why I owe you anything you could ask for saving me.~
@3477=~No, of course not! I mean, I wasn't in control, I don't think I could have stopped her if that was part of her... plan, but no. Yes, she bit my neck and I suppose it was like a kiss, but that was all she did to my body and I didn't enjoy it.~
@3478=~What she did was very personal, but not in that way.~
@3479=~True to you? I mean, I suppose it doesn't matter, but it's not like we... well, never mind, as I said I suppose it doesn't matter. But, no, <CHARNAME>.~
@3480=~I know, my love. But I wouldn't have wished that on you. It happened, you saved me... all worked out for the best. Although I was afraid there was no way out.~
@3481=~If I could have, I would have, but she confronted us with a very special purpose in mind, and she was ready for me. She froze me with that gaze... I couldn't move! And then, in her lair, things got worse.~
@3482=~If I could destroy her again for harming you, I would, but nothing remains of that sick bitch.~
@3483=~I imagine you saw things much like what I see every time Bhaal comes knocking at my subconscious.~
@3484=~Having you back with me is payment enough.~
@3485=~Still, I bet you learned a lot about yourself, and you have returned from a side of existence few will ever experience. That has to be worth something.~
@3486=~Let's not think about this anymore. Come to bed, Kelsey.~
@3487=~Thank you for saying so, <CHARNAME>. I never want to feel so cut off from the world, and so cut off from you, ever again.~
@3488=~It's funny you should say that. I had similar thoughts.~
@3489=~You are right, although I would have rather seen someone else experience it. Or better yet, no one at all.~
@3490=~It is true that I have seen things very few have ever seen, and I think it is even more important that I remember. That we both remember.~
@3491=~As much as I would like to shrug these things off and collapse at your side, there is more I need to say.~
@3492=~<CHARNAME>, Bodhi... she made me... that is, I danced at the beck and call of a very dark power. I succumbed. I was not strong enough to stop her.~
@3493=~But that was one day, and it was a creature who could be destroyed by mortal, or at least mostly mortal hands. But I know that what I saw can't possibly compare to the power and urges of Bhaal.~
@3494=~And yet you fight and win. You control it, you do what's right. I have always respected you for that but now... there really aren't words. I am amazed by you.~
@3495=~It was a reminder to me of what can happen to people when they lose all sense of good and right. And I am glad, I am so, so glad, that you do not let it happen to you. Please, never do.~
@3496=~Shhhh, Kelsey, relax. I know it was hard for you, but don't worry so much about me. Sleep now. I will be here.~
@3497=~It is my strength and determination that keeps us alive, no question there. Not that I needed you to point it out or anything.~
@3498=~You flatter me. I don't do anything you or anyone else could not do.~
@3499=~I draw strength from you, Kelsey. I could never have faced the full force of my taint without you.~
@3500=~Yes... sleep... you're right. I love you, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@3501=~I will say it again any time you need to hear.~
@3502=~(yawn)... My love, I am sorry, but reliving all this has made me exhausted. I need to sleep now.~
@3503=~Thank you again, and good night.~
@3504=~I might have believed that before, but not now. Not after seeing just a fraction of what you must face. You are an inspiration.~
@3505=~I am happy to give you all I can. You are worth it, and more.~
@3506=~<CHARNAME>, what Bodhi did to me, the power she held over me and dangled before me, it... it was unlike anything I had ever contended with before. And I lost. I lost myself.~
@3507=~I would never want anyone else to have to face that kind of loss of control, to give in to the urges of a power deep in their mind trying to make them into something else.~
@3508=~I--what I am trying to say is that I am a little closer to understanding what must go on inside you, and why... why I think it is so important that you win those battles, and keep winning them.~
@3509=~I will do anything you need to help you build your resolve because I don't want to lose you to Bhaal, to some madness... I don't know if I could save you and I--I don't want to find out!~
@3510=~Are you afraid of me, Kelsey? That would be sweet if it wasn't so pitiful.~
@3511=~Don't be so dramatic. I am completely in control of my destiny, and I do what I choose, when I choose.~
@3512=~You are right, Kelsey, it is a fight. But with you and my friends supporting me, I know I can win.~
@3513=~I am only afraid of what might happen, <CHARNAME>. I trust in you, you should know that by now.~
@3514=~I should sleep, <CHARNAME>, I'm sorry... just thinking about Bodhi is exhausting.~
@3515=~I don't think so, <CHARNAME>. Maybe I don't know exactly what you go through but I... I know enough. I know that it is dangerous. And I hope that for both our sakes you can take me seriously.~
@3516=~I will be here for you whenever you need. I have to!~
@3517=~Let us get some rest, <CHARNAME>. I know I'm exhausted just thinking about Bodhi and I have probably given you too much to think about. Good night. Sleep well, my love.~
@3518=~<CHARNAME>, when Bodhi had me... when I lost control, I saw what she wanted. What she had always wanted. I saw the powers that she had harvested for herself, and how she still wanted more.~
@3519=~I could see why she wanted more power, and why she needed more power, and why it would never stop. There was this blackness inside her that could never be filled.~
@3520=~You know that I don't like to tell you how to live your life, but what I saw frightened me, and with good reason. Bodhi let her appetite for power turn her into something inhuman and I think... I know... that the same could happen to you.~
@3521=~I need to know that you are trying, because I truly believe that you will need to fight harder to keep what Bhaal wants you to be at bay. I don't want to lose you to anything, but I watch you sometimes and I worry about the decisions you make. I worry that you are making the wrong choices for the wrong reasons.~
@3522=~I will not be dictated to by you or anyone else. Who do you think you are? Get out of my sight. Now.~
@3523=~I fight, Kelsey, I swear I do... but it is so hard! I know I do terrible things I cannot control, and I hate it! I wish everything was different!~
@3524=~No, <CHARNAME>, please! I am just trying to tell you what I fear could happen! I am not saying that you can't keep it from happening! It's... it's not like it's too late!~
@3525=~Go! NOW!!!~
@3526=~Oh, Kelsey, I'm sorry... my temper got away from me. Damn!~
@3527=~You are so spineless.~
@3528=~Oh... oh damn it all...~
@3529=~No, I am the one who should be sorry. I pushed you at a bad time... shhh, my love, let us just get some rest. I did not mean to hurt you or doubt you. You don't need that, least of all from me.~
@3530=~I was only trying to tell you what I saw, <CHARNAME>. Trying to show you what I felt about you, and how much I care. But if you don't, then... then...~
@3531=~Then... good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@3532=~I would be lying if I said I wasn't, a little. But it's not really you that I'm afraid of, <CHARNAME>. Just what could be, and occasionally... what I see happening.~
@3533=~I had not considered it in quite that way, but I will try, if there is really that much at stake.~
@3534=~But I know who you are inside, the real you, and I love you and I know that you can do what is right. For all of us.~
@3535=~I agree, <CHARNAME>, but I think that you can't just let it happen. If I am right about what I saw, it's important to work towards something better now.~
@3536=~I don't want to lose you. Not for anything. That's why I'm not going to leave your side. Not tonight, not ever.~
@3537=~Please don't get upset! I know that you try! And I am not trying to frighten you, <CHARNAME>, I just need you to know how important it is that we keep trying, and keep looking for ways to control what could happen.~
@3538=~I love you, and I will never give up on you.~
@3539=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I never want to give you the impression that I am watching and judging you. I just want you to know what I know about... about the stakes. You are so important to me, I can't hold anything back.~

@3540=~Anomen, how long do you expect her, or anybody, to put up with your moods? Maybe if you tell us, we can better plan our activities around the uncomfortable silences.~ [FWKLSYP3]
@3541=~You have interrupted my thoughts for the last time! When you address me, I expect to hear your advice on the price of belt leathers and saddle soap, or nothing at all.~
@3542=~Have you ever had a conversation with anyone that didn't end in either threatening them or stomping off?~
@3543=~You try my patience at an extremely unfortunate time, shopkeeper.~
@3544=~We are all going through difficult times, Anomen. Starting conversations with <CHARNAME> just to scream at her does not make things any better.~
@3545=~I warn you, for the last time, to abandon your petty, jealous barbs. I shall finish expressing myself to <CHARNAME>, and you shall be silent.~
@3546=~This unfortunate distraction has not changed my resolve, <CHARNAME>. I offer my heartfelt and unconditional appeal for your forgiveness and understanding.~

@3547=~Save your breath, Kelsey. Your overdue apologies are as meaningless to my lady as your misguided advances. Neither are worthy of her consideration, and we shall be relieved to see an end to them.~
@3548=~Who is this "we", Anomen? You may have your responsibilities at the Order but I doubt anyone entrusts you to think and speak for them.~ [FWKLSYP4]
@3549=~You are not one-tenth the man required to learn the disciplines taught to the Order's most valorous! Nor are you fit to waste <CHARNAME>'s time with your fawning prattle.~
@3550=~Who should she waste her time listening to? You?~
@3551=~I consider <CHARNAME> an excellent judge of character in selecting partners for the discussion of battlefield strategy as well as personal honor. Pray tell, Kelsey, what has she said to you lately?~
@3552=~Well, nothing, because I--~
@3553=~(snort)~
@3554=~--wait, I'm not going to explain myself to you!~
@3555=~<CHARNAME>, please, I don't know what came over me before, but I AM sorry.~

@3556=~You expect my lady to flee from adversity? While I am not surprised to hear that you wish to succumb to cowardice, I will not stand by while you attempt to make her an accomplice to your shame.~
@3557=~Anomen, I was sharing a harmless fantasy, and you were definitely not a part of it when I started it and I definitely want to keep you out of it.~ [FWKLSYP5]
@3558=~Fantasy?!? By Helm, I should strike you down now for such an affront! <CHARNAME> would never soil herself in some sordid tryst!~
@3559=~This is ridiculous. I don't have to justify anything I think to you, Anomen, and I'm quite certain I am thinking a few things right now that would bother you more than any "tryst."~
@3560=~Pah. I would say that sounded like a threat if I could credit you with any backbone.~
@3561=~Good. If you are not actually going to say it, then I will finish my thought to my friend <CHARNAME>.~
@3562=~You shall hear from me soon enough.~
@3563=~<CHARNAME>, the cabin...that wasn't really what I meant to say in the first place. I mean, of course I like the idea, but there was a greater issue on my mind. There still is.~

@3564 = ~That was basely done, <CHARNAME>. I believe that young man is in considerable peril in their hands. I cannot support such treachery, and shall attempt to atone for your misdeeds.~
@3565 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I think we should have helped Kelsey. I think they are going to kill him! I cannot just stand by and watch!~
@3566 = ~Villain! You would betray your companions? I shall no longer count myself among them. May justice find you before I do again.~
@3567=~You have signed Kelsey's death warrant, <CHARNAME>! I can remain in your company under these conditions no longer. The Order must hear of these dealings!~
@3568=~Yes, perhaps when Kelsey has served his purpose, you may serve me even better. Oh, but that is a discussion for another day. Kelsey will do so much for me until then... won't you, my precious Kelsey?~
@3569=~And your reward, as promised. You may well find greater rewards some day if my lady Ceara takes a similar interest in you. I find that her tastes are quite... quite... ah...~
@3570=~Distinguished? Evolved? Eclectic?~
@3571=~Eclectic, yes. Ec-lec-tic. Yes. Farewell.~

@3572=~Please don't make me make this choice, <CHARNAME>. I do love you, but I cannot support you when... when it's just wrong. I need to be able to trust you. And that starts with how you treat others.~
@3573=~I do not see a connection.~
@3574=~All right, Kelsey. All right. You win.~
@3575=~How can you say I cannot be trusted, after all I have done for you?!?~
@3576=~Kelsey, you can take anything I offer you and ask for seconds, but do not try to change me.~
@3577=~It makes me sad to hear that. But there is a connection, and I'm sorry that it will take this much for me to prove it to you. Good...goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@3578=~Please don't say that, <CHARNAME>. This is not about who wins or loses, just being fair to everyone.~
@3579=~Yes, but that doesn't have anything to do with... oh, just forget I said anything, <CHARNAME>. Just do as you will and don't let me get in your way any longer.~
@3580=~If that is your final word, then that is your final word. I did not want to have to see this happen, but... farewell, <CHARNAME>.~

@3581=~It's you! I am glad to see you again. May I rejoin you?~ [FWKLSYP6]
@3582=~Yes, by all means, Kelsey.~
@3583=~Not yet. Hold that thought, though.~

@3584=~Are you sure this is necessary? I don't want to leave you now, there's so much work to do and I'd... I'd like to get to know you better as well.~ [FWKLSYP7]
@3585=~Oh? I am flattered. Stay on.~
@3586=~That might be nice for you, but I need you to stay right here until I need you again.~
@3587=~Yes, this is necessary. Go back to the Promenade, I will see you outside the Adventurer's Mart if I need you.~

@3588=~(sigh) All right, <CHARNAME>. Please don't forget about me.~
@3589=~I hope to see you there soon, <CHARNAME>.~
@3590=~Please, my Kelsey, it will not be for long. Go to the Adventurer's Mart and wait. Heckle the merchants for me, I am sure you will have a good time.~
@3591=~I imagine I will, but it won't be as good as being with you. Come soon.~
@3600=~(Kelsey clenches his fist nervously.) The sooner we are gone from here, and back to something more like normal, the happier I will be. Let us just do what needs to be done.~

@3601=~Oh, my love, I saw Irenicus fall but then it looked as though you had died, then I thought I had died and now this... this does not look like a dying illusion or dream. Have we really been dragged to Hell?~ [FWKLSYP8]
@3602=~I won't leave your side, <CHARNAME>. Let us find out what power brought us here, and find a way back home.~

// TRANSLATORS! 6022-6035 are already in Kelsey-TOB, file KelseyG.tra. Lines are unchanged.

@6022=~I hope it is time for us to be together again...as we should be.~ [FWKL2592]
@6023=~Yes. I am sorry we had to be parted.~
@6024=~Not just yet, I fear.~
@6025=~As you say. Please, don't stay away much longer.~

@6031=~My dear...please reconsider. Things are happening so fast...I do not want to be separated from you, not now!~ [FWKL2594]
@6032=~You are probably right. Forget I said anything.~
@6034=~Do not worry. Stay here, I will come back for you.~
@6035=~Yes, but who will watch out for you in the meantime? Ahhh, never mind, I am sure you will be fine. See you soon.~

// TRANSLATORS! 6145-6168 are already in Kelsey-TOB, file KelseyG.tra. Lines are unchanged. Please don't duplicate your work!

@6145=~And we lived through the night! I hope you slept well, and I am glad that time together gave you this trust in me.~ [FWKL25J5]
@6146=~I'm sorry if I was a little... intense, <CHARNAME>. I have been thinking about this for so long that I might have been carried away.~ [FWKL25J6]
@6147=~You were everything I expected, Kelsey. Take that as you will.~
@6148=~Yes, I had hoped that my--er, that our first time together might be more romantic.~
@6149=~You were, but I loved where you carried me to, Kelsey. It was wonderful.~
@6150=~Shhhh, don't speak. I will treasure our first night together forever.~
@6151=~I will, once I decide how I think you meant it.~
@6152=~I let my impatience get the better of me. Again, I am sorry.~
@6153=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It was very special for me as well.~
@6154=~I'm glad. I'm glad it was what you wanted.~
@6155=~I love you, <CHARNAME>. I learned to love your mind and now I have loved your body. And I will hate to leave it, even for a time, but I know we have work that must be done. I think your top landed somewhere behind my head...~
@6156=~(sigh) Give it here. But throw it further tonight, so it won't be so easy to leave our bed again.~
@6157=~Not so fast. So was I as good as your other lovers?~
@6158=~Not so fast. We are going to try this again, but this time, *I* will set the pace.~
@6159=~Even now, you are ever the model of timely efficiency, Kelsey.~
@6160=~Good thinking, Kelsey. There is, after all, a time and place for all things. And when we have time, I will once again show you the place.~
@6161=~Consider it done, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@6162=~<CHARNAME>, of course, but... I mean, it is so different with each...~
@6163=~...let me try this again. You are the most important person in my life, and I am not lying to you when I say that I have never enjoyed being with another, during the day or at night, as much as I love being with you.~
@6164=~There is no comparison, because you are the one I love. And you always will be.~
@6165=~I... ah. Heh. I will gladly do whatever you say! (Kelsey grins broadly as you descend upon him...)~
@6166=~It's not that I want to forget about last night! I just want to be sure that you don't think I am forgetting what you need to accomplish just so that we can lie together on my whims.~
@6167=~Besides, I have always thought it one of my better qualities. I will find a way to make it serve you, someday...~
@6168=~(Kelsey glances over your peacefully nude body and sits slack-jawed in response to your promise.) I promise that I will be there, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
