@1 = ~Korgan, why are you still hanging around? By now you could have cashed out of this company with a share bigger than even you could carry. So... "what gives?"~ [FWKL2500]
@2 = ~Oh, aye, we've collected a king's portion of loot and opened arteries, but I canna fade into the sunset just now. Firstly, I know ye would cry at the parting, ye tremendous pansy, and I could ne'er stand the sight.~
@3=~Part 'o the attraction is that <CHARNAME>'s wake keeps churnin' up a freak show that puts even you and the Wingless Wonder over there to shame.~
@4=~Oooohhh... l-leave me out of this, both of you!~
@5=~Part 'o the attraction is that <CHARNAME>'s wake keeps churnin' up a freak show that puts even you and that rodent-loving basket case to shame.~
@6=~Oooh! Did you hear that, Boo? We are an attraction now!~
@7=~Part 'o the attraction is that <CHARNAME>'s wake keeps churnin' up a freak show that puts even you and that dirt-loving nature boy to shame.~
@8=~As a crafty mackerel may avoid a fisherman who casts his lure too noisily, so I see the bait dangling before me... and will let it float by.~
@9=~Part 'o the attraction is that <CHARNAME>'s wake keeps churnin' up a freak show that puts even yer sorry hide to shame.~
@10=~Admit it. You want to know what happens to <CHARNAME>. Even you are past the money at this stage.~
@11=~Only a fool folds a hot hand when the killin' is easy and the rewards are plentiful. (sigh) But, aye, damn it all, I must know how this story ends. Even if it means lingerin' with a pink-lovin' coward.~

@12=~Here, smell this.~
@13=~What?~ [FWKL2501]
@14=~I said "smell this," ye nose-pickin' fruitcake! Yer the prancer in the robes, smell this here sash-ay, or whatever ye bloody fancy types call it, and tell me if ye think a lass or two would approve.~
@15=~(sniff) Urk...~
@16=~Where have you been keeping this?~
@17=~NO, wait, never mind, don't answer that.~
@18=~Twas in me breeches and I'll not shy from telling yer grandmam afore she goes to church! Even a hard man must try something new, from time to time.~
@19=~Perfume... doesn't strike me as the New Leaf for Korgan Bloodaxe to be turning over.~
@20=~Not that I'd expect a nancy to understand, but a lady acquaintance gave it to me, and sometimes a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.~
@21=~Kicked out of another brothel for stinking up the place, eh?~
@22=~That sort o' slander has been the death 'o bigger than ye, arsewart!~
@23=~These above-grounder waifs simply have no sense for a man who smells of his labors.~
@24=~But, Korgan, your "labors" usually involve bloody murder. Not many women I know want to go to bed with their nostrils full of slaughterhouse.~
@25=~Aye, that's as may be, but at least I'm makin' a livin'! Ask me to tell, I'll tell ye women don't know what they want and ask for it too bloody often!~
@26=~Maybe you're just not man enough to... give it to them, Korgan. Nudge nudge.~
@27=~I heard that, axebait.~

@28=~I imagine recent events have you more than a little scared, Kelsey. It's all right, you can admit it.~
@29=~I'm not sure what you're getting at, Anomen.~ [FWKL2502]
@30=~This messy business of warring Bhaalspawn. After all, the taint that gives you your strange sorcerous powers may not be all that different from <CHARNAME>'s. You may even be Bhaalspawn yourself, for all we know.~
@31=~Doubtful. Aside from the fact that my father was a very mortal man whom I knew very well and loved very much, you didn't see Irenicus chase me down, or me change into the Slayer, did you?~
@32=~Aye, but perhaps they simply have not worked their way down the list yet. Or perhaps your blot comes from an entirely different source, one whose bloody purges are still to come. I would be concerned for the future if I were you, Kelsey.~
@33=~Anomen, as much as I may have felt isolated at times, I'm hardly the first sorcerer to walk the earth.~
@34=~I survived a very high-profile trip through the very anti-magic Amn, and I think I'll be all right from this point forward.~
@35=~As you say, Kelsey. I would make quite certain to cast your protection spells at night, just in case they come for you when you sleep, if I were you.~
@36=~And if I were you, I would try to be less of a prig. Probably for the same reason.~

@37=~Hah! An embarrassment of riches!~
@38=~Counting your coins, bard?~ [FWKL2503]
@39=~Nay, mystical sandpiper. Counting my chapters! Fair truth is, mine journals are bursting at the seams with the strange and wondrous record of our journey... a tale that will be hard pressed to grow with the retelling!~
@40=~I thought nothing could compare to your home. Or so you keep telling us, night after night after night...~
@41=~Ah, yes. But my raven is truly the headline event of the multiverse, strange though it seems. This, truly, is the best seat, and the best stage, in all the worlds.~
@42=~But my Sigil is still dear. How could it not be? Why, in my Sigil, one may lunch with a glabrezu, sip tea with a succubus... the possibilities are endless.~
@43=~Dramatic license?~
@44=~Nay, fact. Fact stranger than fiction.~
@45=~Uh huh. I doubt that sort of a place is as romantic as you make it sound. I imagine the real truth is a little more like, "one may be lunched BY a glabrezu, or get sipped BY a succubus."~
@46=~Why, Kelsey, I see you emerging from your cocoon of good intentions a full-grown pessimist moth! I shall make a Doomguarder of yon sandpiper yet!~

@47=~You have done well for yourself, Kelsey. Not every young man given the magical gifts you wield would be able to resist temptation and walk the just path.~
@48=~You do realize that it's a little easier to behave when a paladin is looking over your shoulder, though, right?~ [FWKL2504]
@49=~Yes, that much is true, for a few hours. Perhaps for a day. True character tends to seep through a fa√ßade like bad ink, however.~
@50=~Then I am flattered by your expert judgement. I'll... try to keep up the good work, I suppose.~
@51=~I did not bring this up to give you a medal, Kelsey. I am concerned that while your heart is in the right place, your soul still lacks purpose.~
@52=~Worthy men must work towards a greater purpose, or they become idle, wasted, and watch impotently as the world passes them by. You must find the best exercise of your abilities.~
@53=~If you are suggesting I leave <CHARNAME>, forgive me, but you might wish to have a healer check your vision. I don't intend to leave her side. No offense, Keldorn, but the lifestyle you have chosen, away from your wife, would not suit me.~
@54=~I appreciate that the decisions I have made are not for everyone, young man. But you cannot live your life solely fighting battles for another... no matter how much you value them.~
@55=~I'm not sure what I can say that will make you feel any better, then.~
@56=~It is enough, for now. I am pleased that you and <CHARNAME> are happy together, but men of ability and purpose must do more than love. 'Twas a painful lesson to learn, but I have found that it is true.~
@57=~What are you getting at? You, yourself, seem content to pursue that greater purpose in <CHARNAME>'s company. Why should it be different for me?~
@58=~Yes, of course, you and I are in the right place today. But <CHARNAME>'s trials WILL end soon, one way or another. I will have the Order's principles, which I have lived by for decades, to guide me from that day forward. What will you have?~
@59=~If I struck you as vague or scattered in the past... well, I suppose I can see why. But the past few weeks have put the value of human life in a new perspective--for all of us, I would wager, and I think you should give me credit for seeing that.~
@60=~I don't know that I will need to belong to a club just to keep that perspective clear.~
@61=~I fear I have not exactly made my point. But, we can discuss this later. No doubt you, too, may begin to tune me out as the doddering father figure of the group.~
@62=~I doubt it would come to that. A little... fathering every once in a while is good for everybody.~

@63=~Kelsey, I make it my business to keep an eye on the group's behavior, and yours has been troubling of late. Do you need to talk about something? Are you... depressed?~
@64=~Not actively, not that I am aware of, Mazzy, why?~ [FWKL2505]
@65=~Well... several times, since we arrived in Saradush, I noticed you gazing at the ground, which is usually a sign that a human is emotionally distressed. I would like to help if that is indeed the case.~
@66=~Oh! I didn't realize anybody would notice. Sorry, no, I'm not upset about anything, Mazzy. Actually, I'm inspecting the local footwear.~
@67=~It's bizarre, I know, with everything that's going on around us, but I guess it's my merchant instincts. I've always been fascinated by the variations in what people put on their feet, based on where they live.~
@68=~Perhaps you should suspend your usual curiosity, Kelsey. We must all be alert, and I do not mean for fashion trends!~
@69=~I know, I know... but really, it is quite interesting. The thong sandals and light canvas of Saradush would never catch on in Athkatla, for example. The weather is too unpredictable, it wouldn't be practical.~
@70=~I fail to see the attraction, Kelsey. Please, try to be more focused.~
@71=~I think it says a lot about our different backgrounds that you aren't remotely interested. I suppose halfling footwear does not vary much from place to place...~
@72=~No. I should say there are few tradesmen more lonely than a halfling cobbler.~
@73=~Mmmmph. (giggle) My apologies. The image is... amusing.~
@74=~I must remember to lead with a cobbler joke if I'm ever trading with a halfling again...~

@75=~For a wizard who does not know anything about being a wizard, you know more about being a butt-kicking wizard than any wizard I have ever seen. Minsc and Boo salute you, Kelsey!~
@76=~That might be the most genuine compliment I have ever received from a man and his hamster.~ [FWKL2506]
@77=~Keep up the good work and it shall not be your last! If you are very good, Boo may deliver his next award personally! Right, Boo?~

@78=~Kelsey... what's wrong? You're bleeding! Did--oh no, did I forget to heal you after our last battle?~
@79=~No, Aerie, it's all right. It's just my nose, I get little nosebleeds from time to time. I have ever since I was a boy. I don't think it's anything you need to worry about.~ [FWKL2507]
@80=~Are you sure? A little curing spell really is no trouble... you know I like to help.~
@81=~No, it's fine. In a strange way, I kind of like them. They remind me of my father.~
@82=~Oh, did he have trouble with nosebleeds, too?~
@83=~No, but whenever I had one, he would say that it was because I was thinking too hard, and my brains were trying to shove through my nose.~
@84=~That was funny... the first dozen times, then I just thought he was dumb to keep making the same joke over and over. But I wish he was still around to say it.~
@85=~I understand what you mean. There were so many beautiful things about my home that I took for granted... until it was gone.~
@86=~But if we keep talking about this I'll probably start crying, while you bleed all over your shirt. That wouldn't... look right.~
@87=~That's okay, if <CHARNAME> asks I'll just tell <PRO_HIMHER> I owed you money, and you hit me until I paid up. Then you felt guilty about the whole thing.~
@88=~Don't you dare!~

@89=~Oh, Kelsey... I have been having the s-strangest dreams lately.~
@90=~So have I, now that you mention it.~ [FWKL2508]
@91=~In my dreams, you and <CHARNAME> return with me to Faenya-Dail. O-Only... only instead of wings and clouds, my people now live underwater and breathe through gills, except the water floats above the land...~
@92=~Uh huh...~
@93=~A-And... and instead of hating me for losing my wings, everyone is asking why I don't have gills. And we try to eat in the water but we don't know how and it just turns into a terrible mess.~
@94=~I guess it's kind of silly. I think I worry too much about what the Avariel would think of me now, when it doesn't matter... n-not really.~
@95=~Well, it's no sillier than the dream I had last night. You were in that one, as a matter of fact.~
@96=~Oh?~
@97=~Mine, uh, isn't quite as interesting as yours. I can't remember all the details, but I seem to remember that I was doing the "got your nose" trick on you for about 15 minutes and you got really mad at me.~
@98=~You said you wanted your nose back, and would never talk to me again.~
@99=~(laughs) Oh, Kelsey, that is ridiculous! I'd never fall for that trick, and even if I did, I wouldn't get that mad about it.~
@100=~I know. I think I need a vacation.~
@101=~Well, let's go somewhere where we don't have to eat underwater!~
@102=~Oh, Aerie... you really make me smile. If only things were a little different...~
@103=~Wh-what? What do you mean?~
@104=~Nothing. Forget I said anything.~

@105=~Kelsey, about last night... was that really the best you could do?~
@106=~Maybe I am a little out of practice, but I don't usually get complaints. You certainly didn't complain at the time, Viconia... you seemed quite relieved.~ [FWKL2509]
@107=~I am complaining now, weakling. Your efforts were so timid and halting. Just recalling your inept movements makes me physically ill.~
@108=~I was simply trying to be gentle with you, considering the circumstances.~
@109=~The thought of you glowering over me, scanning my exposed flesh, will haunt my daydreams for weeks.~
@110=~Viconia, you came to me! I made no promises. If you were so desperate and you wanted it done right, why didn't you just do it yourself?~
@111=~I mean, whoever heard of a high priestess of Shar who can't get a splinter out of her own foot?~
@112=~You will know suffering before our days together are through, Kelsey. Suffering, and blackness.~

@113=~Valygar, perhaps when things settle down a touch, you will let me buy you dinner.~ [FWKL2510]
@114=~I have been responsible for feeding myself for decades. I see no reason to turn that duty over to you.~
@115=~Then how about I simply buy you a drink?~
@116=~I won't be thirsty. I take care of that myself as well.~
@117=~Then what can I do for you that will end with us having a nice pleasant chat like friends should, rather than the usual one-way flow of growls and stares that would be all I would remember you for if you vanished tomorrow morning?~
@118=~I have no intention of letting you or anyone else buy my friendship.~
@119=~You mistake our service together as a reason for us to become close friends.~
@120=~What's wrong with you and I being friends?~
@121=~You should know by now how I feel about magic. I respect that you did not choose to be born with your curse, but you did choose to make it a part of you, rather than fight it.~
@122=~You know as well as I that you have embraced the powers. You know as well as I where they can lead.~
@123=~I think you have let your family's reign of terror cloud your vision. What about Elminster? He has tremendous power, and works for what I think you would agree is right. Is he the maniacal baby-eater you think I will become?~

@124=~Oh, Kelsey... you are a man of business, are you not? Well, Jan Jansen has a business proposition for you.~
@125=~Let me guess. Turnips Express. Ground-floor opportunity. Unlimited growth potential. Only needs 5000 gold to capitalize, and another few thousand to hire employees, build wagons, bribe local officials and build the catapults that will launch the turnips to customers all across the Sword Coast?~ [FWKL2511]
@126=~What? Have you been reading my diary?~
@127=~No, this isn't about turnips, my boy. I want you to think big, really big, like Alton Murahh's Great Turnip Harvest big. Kelsey, my boy, once we've wrapped up this Bhaal business, how's about we set our sights on elevating you to extra-planar power as well? I think you and I would make one heck of a team.~
@128=~Not that I'm taking you seriously, Jan, but I would think <CHARNAME>'s trials are a lesson to us all that some power just isn't worth the price.~
@129=~Tsk, tsk. Not at all. <CHARNAME> is going about this business the hard way.~
@130=~No offense, of course, your potential omnipotenceness.~
@131=~Okay. Enlighten me. What's the shortcut to godhood?~
@132=~Glad you asked. You see, it's all about having the portfolio. You get the portfolio, and you get the rest of the godly goods. How did Cyric become a god? He snatched Bhaal's murder portfolio. The gods are very sensitive about their important portfolios and they cling greedily to them and they won't even let you borrow them as a favor after you've let them use your summer home every year for five years running. I'm still not sure I'll ever speak to Selune again. Some people just have no sense of reciprocation.~
@133=~But let's face it, everybody and everything needs a deity, but not all of the portfolios are as sexy as the rest, or even deserve having their own gods to look after them. So--and this is the good part--the gods put these lesser portfolios into a pool, and every six months they hold a lottery to see who gets stuck moonlighting as the patron of smelly cheeses, or hangnail sufferers, or wombat breeders.~
@134=~So where do we come in?~
@135=~I should have thought it would be obvious to a career bureaucrat like yourself by now! Paperwork being what it is, some of it inevitably gets lost from time to time and and hardly anybody cares. It just so happens that I know a deva who's very dissatisfied with the paper-pushing grind. I don't think it would take much at all on our part to convince her to simply, ah, lose one of those portfolios, which will just HAPPEN to turn up in your possession a short while later!~
@136=~So this grand scheme is designed to make me the new lord of stubbed toes? Won't whoever drew that job make me fight to the death for it, like Bhaal and Cyric?~
@137=~Less chance of that than Golodon winning the "Man of the Year" award! Whoever drew it will be happy to let you have it, since he'll have more free time to spend at the astral craps tables. Some of your more stuffed-shirt types like Helm will probably cry foul once our brilliant ruse is inevitably detected, but possession is at least nine-tenths of the law even for the gods.~
@138=~I... see. So, what's your angle on this, Jan? You said it was a business deal.~
@139=~Well, a new god is going to need an advisor, an aide-de-camp, someone to manage the boring details... sorting through prayers, conducting long, in-depth interviews with candidates for High Priestess, and so forth. I've always admired great powers behind great thrones, and if you'll allow a compliment from your humble-servant-to-be, that melon on your shoulders has "friendly, pliable figurehead" written all over it.~
@140=~Wow. I've heard of social climbing, but really, Jan, that's ridiculous.~
@141=~Can't blame a gnome for trying.~
@142=~Let me know soon if you want in, otherwise I'm going to have to offer this opportunity to my second choice, Binky over there. This time the plan will be simpler... less chance of gumming up the works with those finer details, eh, Binky?~
@143=~I hope you enjoy eating your lunch through a straw, gnome.~
@144=~Let me know soon if you want in, otherwise I'm going to have to offer this opportunity to my second choice. Say, Aerie, ever considered the advantages of godhood? You'll never have to do your own laundry again.~
@145=~Oh, Jan. Sometimes I think you're just too silly for your own good.~
@146=~Was that a "maybe"?~
@147=~Let me know soon if you want in, otherwise I'm going to have to offer this opportunity to my second choice, Our Lady of Poison Sumac over there. How about it, Jaheira? You, me, and the celestial expanses?~
@148=~If I could only go to heaven with a Jansen, I might choose not to go at all. Somehow I do not find appealing the prospect of enduring your yammering for eternity.~
@149=~Don't knock it until you try it, my dear.~
@150=~Let me know soon if you want in, otherwise I'm going to have to offer this opportunity to my second choice, Korgan, who I'm sure will jump at the opportunity.~
@151=~Aye, and we'll nay be having talk o' "figureheads" unless you figure on losing yours, gnome! Ahhh, but yer heart is in the right place, even if yer mouth be full o' the usual manure.~

@152=~You. I don't know you, sorcerer. You were not with my dear sibling when we... settled our differences.~
@153=~No, I wasn't. Our acquaintance is more... recent. Why don't I get the impression you're pleased to know me now?~ [FWKL2512]
@154=~Your service to <CHARNAME> is between you and <PRO_HESHE>. I simply find it interesting that <PRO_HISHER> cast of supporting players has changed somewhat.~
@155=~Well, you would have to ask <PRO_HIMHER> for the precise details, but it's my understanding that a fair number of <PRO_HISHER> former companions turned up dead in Amn. Irenicus murdered some, and I believe things went downhill from there.~
@156=~Fascinating. Truly fascinating, that my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>'s wake of death and destruction crushes even those who seek refuge in <PRO_HISHER> shadow. Does that not trouble you?~
@157=~Only when you put it in such an over-dramatic fashion. Some of us are still alive. And the premium <CHARNAME> seems to place on your well-being cannot help but inspire us all.~
@158=~<CHARNAME> needs me more than you can know, sorcerer. Do not presume to consider yourself my equal, on any level.~

@159=~Sarevok...~ [FWKL2513]
@160=~Before you ask your question, be aware that I punish stupid questions with sharp edges.~
@161=~(ahem)... having been... dead for a while, was there anything you... you know... missed?~
@162=~You mean, did I long for the sound of chirping birds, the smell of flowers, that nonsense?~
@163=~Yes, that nonsense, if you like.~
@164=~The experience was not something I care to explain to you. You have no frame of reference, and mine is rapidly fading from memory.~
@165=~But surely there was something different? Something memorable?~
@166=~I missed... I realized, very early on, that I missed breathing. As will you. And once you start missing it, it will be very difficult to stop thinking about.~
@167=~Now take a deep breath, and leave me be.~

@168=~... come on, Jaheira. There must be something.~ [FWKL2514]
@169=~Leave it be, Kelsey. I have no time for this.~
@170=~Poker? Hearts?~
@171=~No, and no.~
@172=~Bridge? Canasta?~
@173=~... no.~
@174=~Fizbin? Double Fanucci?~
@175=~No!~
@176=~Come on, something. Anything. Three-card monty? Who can't spare a few minutes of their life to play three-card monty? I'll even let you win, I'll make them ALL the queen.~
@177=~Stop.~
@178=~I don't understand why you're so opposed to relaxing and having fun. I'm not making an indecent proposal, here, just trying to find a card game you might enjoy playing this evening. Who doesn't like playing cards?~
@179=~Kelsey, I am not your playmate. Take up juggling if you need to be entertained.~
@180=~I'm lousy at it. I'm lousy at cards, too, but at least that's something people can be lousy at together.~
@181=~Aaaagh! Enough.~
@182=~Enough what?~
@183=~... Very well. IF I am not too tired, we can play poker this evening. Knaves or better to open, chase the ace. And I deal.~
@184=~Ahah! I knew it!~

@185=~I cannot believe that the power you have accumulated still has provided you no vision or purpose.~
@186=~Oh, I don't know, Edwin. It has given me the vision to see what a nasty little grub you are, and renewed my purpose not to end up that way myself.~ [FWKL2515]
@187=~(Peasant trickster.) Just stand there grinning and say "thank you, sir, may I have another?"~

@188=~Kelsey, do you have time for a... philosophical question?~ [FWKLNA00]
@189=~I have time for a lot more than that for you, Nalia.~ [FWKL2516]
@190=~Oh, please.~ [FWKLNA01]

@191=~I don't know that I'm one of the great thinkers of our time, but... sure.~ [FWKL2517]
@192=~Define the word "enough." As you prepare your answer, please consider your position both as a mage and as a member of the petty bourgeoisie.~ [FWKLNA02]
@193=~Enough as in what? Enough food, enough happiness, enough sex, what?~
@194=~Just "enough." What does "enough" mean, to you?~
@195=~Well, enough is having more than you need, but not so much that you appear greedy. Enough is being satisfied... maybe even a little complacent. It's good to have enough.~
@196=~I see. Fascinating. Anything else?~
@197=~Enough... well, it would be nice if everybody had enough of everything, although I think that might get pretty strange since wanting is sometimes better than having.~
@198=~Yes, all very interesting.~
@199=~So how does Miss deArnise define "enough"?~
@200=~That would be telling.~
@201=~What? If that's the way you're going to be, next time you're paying by the hour for my insights.~

@202=~I've been wanting to have this talk with you for days, but things were so quiet for a change, that it just didn't seem right. And now... now it's happening all over again.~ [FWKL2518]
@203=~Uh, what?~
@204=~I want you to meet the new me, who is sick of listening to the old you.~
@205=~If you have something on your mind, spit it out.~
@206=~I'm always here for you, you should know that by now. Please, talk to me.~
@207=~Oh, there you go, trying to develop a sense of humor. Never mind.~
@208=~I'm sorry, I'll start again.~
@209=~What can I do except tell you... everything?~
@210=~<CHARNAME>, I want to apologize. You went through so much chasing down Irenicus, and I do not feel like I gave you the support you deserved.~
@211=~I felt like there was nothing I could say to help... help you track a madman, and quiet the essence of a god inside you.~
@212=~I felt that if I dwelled on it, you would see how powerless I was, and maybe even start to doubt yourself as well. All I could do was relate my own stupid stories, as if they could matter to anyone in your situation.~
@213=~It's okay, Kelsey. Your stories aren't stupid and they did the job.~
@214=~So you were being selfish. Everyone wants to feel important.~
@215=~Kelsey, I love you and I love your stories. Don't be silly.~
@216=~My situation was... unique. I think we both struggled to handle it.~
@217=~I know you were doing the best you could.~
@218=~I hope you're not just saying that.~
@219=~You handled everything perfectly, <CHARNAME>. I mean, you found time for me, AND you beat the bad guy. Incredible.~
@220=~Selfish? I... yes, you may have a point. I don't mean to be, but sometimes I just get overwhelmed by everything there is to know about you.~
@221=~But what have I ever really done for you? Aside from helping you in battle, what else do I know? I could hardly make you a cream to force the Slayer to stay away! And I can't make the prophecies disappear just by rubbing the backs of your thighs.~
@222=~So... what I am saying is that I am truly sorry if I have neglected you, as a person. It wasn't intentional, <CHARNAME>... but I just don't know how exactly to make things better for you.~
@223=~Rub my thighs. I'll tell you if anything else comes to mind after that.~
@224=~Then try to treat me like more of a person, not an object to be loved or feared.~
@225=~As usual, you're making yourself out to be worse than you really are. You make me feel good... you make me feel loved.~
@226=~You're a crummy salesman, you just about have me convinced that you're a lousy boyfriend.~
@227=~You... (grin) are a magnificently forgiving woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@228=~I hope so, <CHARNAME>. I only want to return the happiness you share with me... it's only fair.~
@229=~Maybe I need to get straight what I'm trying to tell you before I try this again. Sorry to bother you, <CHARNAME>...~
@230=~Is that how you think I see you? I don't think that's quite right...~
@231=~Yes, I love you... and, I admit, watching some of your more graphic struggles was... frightening. But if I truly have made you feel like a "thing"... oh, gods, I'm very sorry.~
@232=~Well, it is something you need to work on.~
@233=~Frankly, I have found it insulting and offensive and it needs to stop.~
@234=~It's not really like that. Now, if you will please return to the subject of my aching thighs...~
@235=~I will try, my dear.~
@236=~... I understand.~

@237=~You know, my love, to me you are like... like ice cream in the dead of winter.~ [FWKL2519]
@238=~That makes no sense.~
@239=~I make your teeth hurt and give you a headache?~
@240=~You want to eat me up with a spoon?~
@241=~I'm... yummy?~
@242=~I make you cold and fat?~
@243=~Sure it does. At least, it did when I blurted it out. Let me try to explain.~
@244=~No, silly person. You cure my headaches.~
@245=~(laugh) As a matter of fact, yes, but that wasn't what I was thinking of.~
@246=~Well, let's see... I think I can still taste you from that good-morning kiss... and yes, you're yummy but that wasn't what I was thinking of.~
@247=~You put off plenty of heat, I would say... no, that wasn't what I meant.~
@248=~Everybody loves ice cream, right? But some folks say you shouldn't eat ice cream when it is freezing cold out, because you will "catch a draft" or you simply won't enjoy it as much as when it's warm.~
@249=~But if you REALLY love ice cream, you should appreciate it all the time--not just when it does you a favor by cooling you off, but for what it is, no matter the situation.~
@250=~I could care for you anytime, anywhere. Anybody could--you're like ice cream, everybody should like you. I can't deny that it would be easier, though, if things were not so confused and dangerous.~
@251=~That's how I feel about you, <CHARNAME>. I can't deny that it would be easier to--to care about you as much as I do if it were a calm summer day, but even though some old granny tells me that it will give me a headache and a fever, I just want to be with you, my little bowl of ice cream.~
@252=~That has got to be the most ridiculous thing you have ever said.~
@253=~(laugh) You're cute, Kelsey, even if you don't make much sense.~
@254=~I never knew you had a food fetish.~
@255=~Just give me the short version--was that a compliment?~
@256=~I will always be your, uh, bowl of ice cream, Kelsey, if you will be my one and only spoon.~
@257=~It... it makes more sense if you can see the way I feel about you in my mind, <CHARNAME>.~
@258=~I guess that probably didn't come across as the world's greatest metaphor but it makes sense to me, <CHARNAME>. And I'll say anything to get a laugh from my favorite heroine.~
@259=~I do not think that I do. I am really talking about you, I'm not thinking about dairy products. I'm just telling you what I feel.~
@260=~Did you miss the smile on my face when I called you "my little bowl of ice cream"? Of course! I know that it was not an award-winning turn of phrase, but I am just telling you what I feel.~
@261=~I feel like I can just tell you whatever is on my mind without having to force it to make perfect sense. I want us to be that comfortable with each other.~
@262=~All right! What more could a man ask for, but to be a wanted spoon by his favorite ice cream?~
@263=~I'm glad you see where I'm coming from... since I started talking without really thinking things through...~

@264=~I don't think I've said this, at least not lately... thank you, for being you, and letting me love you.~ [FWKL2520]
@265=~Actually, you have, but let's not argue about it.~
@266=~I love you too, so what else could I do?~
@267=~You're just so persistent, I can't resist.~
@268=~You're good at it.~
@269=~Yeah, I have been meaning to bring that up. I think it's time you stopped.~
@270=~What, thanking you?~
@271=~Yes... you're sweet, Kelsey, but you don't have to keep saying you love me every five minutes.~
@272=~No, hounding me. This isn't working out and I want to be left alone.~
@273=~Sorry. I know it's a habit, but I know I'd rather say it... and hear it, even... too much, rather than too little.~
@274=~That makes me happy, <CHARNAME>.~
@275=~You make me smile, <CHARNAME>, but I truly hope that you spend time with me because I help make you happy, not just because I can't help myself.~
@276=~Ooooh, well, thank you.~
@277=~After... after all we have been through, this is how you would end our relationship?~
@278=~I don't understand. What have I not done? I have been your friend, your lover, your soldier...~
@279=~(remain silent)~
@280=~I find you cloying and weak.~
@281=~You are just not man enough for me. Sorry.~
@282=~You bother me, and I don't have to explain myself to you.~
@283=~Weak relationships stand in the way of what I want.~
@284=~I can't believe you... that you would do this to me.~
@285=~Oh, I see. Then... then I will take my weakness where it won't be such an impediment. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@286=~You could have said something... I could have changed for you, <CHARNAME>... I... I would do anything for you.~
@287=~Oh. I'm too human, too mortal for the spawn of the gods? Whenever the reminder of humanity becomes too much for you to take, you just let me know and I'll pack my bags, then.~
@288=~I am so glad we found each other, and that we have survived together.~
@289=~And I wanted to tell you that as much as I love you during the day... I love to love you at night.~
@290=~I'm not... bothering you in that respect, am I? Too much? I mean, are you... satisfied, with me?~
@291=~I think we should slow things down. We both need our rest and focus.~
@292=~Not exactly, Kelsey. You need to be more patient.~
@293=~Yes, Kelsey. You are splendid with me, really.~
@294=~I... can't... answer that, you're embarrassing me!~
@295=~We're doing just fine.~
@296=~I... er... if you think so, <CHARNAME>.~
@297=~Good night, then, dear. Sorry to keep you awake.~
@298=~Oh... I'm truly sorry, darling, I didn't realize. I thought... well, never mind.~
@299=~I... I would like to try harder, to be what you want... is now all right? To start trying harder, that is?~
@300=~Not tonight. I think it would be best if you just waited for me to bring it up again.~
@301=~Sure thing, lover. Remember... be patient.~
@302=~I am glad... that really is what I want. I am glad it means as much to you.~
@303=~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable talking about us. I just want to know how you feel... how I make you feel. Think about telling me when you're more comfortable, at least.~
@304=~Good. I do hope to get... better, for you.~
@305=~I will, I promise.~
@306=~Mmmmm... help me out of these clothes which have suddenly become very, very, very inconvenient.~
@307=~I do love you so, <CHARNAME>...~
@308=~Are you... too tired tonight?~
@309=~No, of course not, my love. Please, come to me.~
@310=~I don't feel ready tonight, Kelsey.~
@311=~Not tonight. I think it would be best if you just waited for me to bring it up again.~
@312=~I understand. Good night, my favorite heroine, my love.~

@313=~I wanted to talk to you. About us.~ [FWKL2521]
@314=~Is something wrong with us? I feel fine, are you all right?~
@315=~Is this about sex again? Typical.~
@316=~Please do, my love.~
@317=~What is on your mind?~
@318=~This is not a good time.~
@319=~That... is exactly what I want to talk to you about, <CHARNAME>.~
@320=~Yes, I'm fine, and you're as wonderful as ever. But there is something I need to talk to you about.~
@321=~Uh. Yes, but please, hear me out.~
@322=~When I asked you about making love, it was not the right time for you, and I understood. I understand.~
@323=~But I cannot stop thinking about it. I do love you, and I want to love you, more than I already have.~
@324=~Is it something I have or haven't done, <CHARNAME>? I really do want you to be comfortable with me first, of course, but... I thought and hoped you would be, by now.~
@325=~This just is not the right time or place, Kelsey. I want it to be special. Don't you?~
@326=~You are just not man enough for me. Sorry.~
@327=~You are right, we have waited long enough. I would love to spend this evening with you, my Kelsey, my love.~
@328=~Kelsey, it is entirely too dangerous. What if... what if I become the Slayer? I can't take that risk with you.~
@329=~I agree... I want nothing more than to lay you down on the biggest bed in Trademeet and slam the shutters and never see another soul again until we've loved so much it hurts, but that may never happen for us!~
@330=~I know that together, we can handle almost anything, but I also know that both of us are still very mortal.~
@331=~Call me pitiful, call me pent-up... I don't care. I love you, <CHARNAME>, and I need you... and I want you. Please. We can make it be special, I promise.~
@332=~Didn't your mother teach you anything about the word "no"? No!~
@333=~I--all right, Kelsey. If it means this much to you, then yes.~
@334=~I... I want you too, Kelsey.~
@335=~I am so glad, <CHARNAME>... truly.~
@336=~Here, let me help you out of those inconvenient things...~
@337=~I love you, <CHARNAME>. Always.~
@338=~I admit, the thought has occurred to me. I... well, you are not who I know you to be in that form, but I also know that it is not really you.~
@339=~Besides, I thought you were fully in control of the Slayer by now.~
@340=~I was worried how you might feel, that you might find me... ugly, because I can do that.~
@341=~I did not want to see you hurt, but perhaps you're right. I AM in control.~
@342=~I can control the Slayer, under normal circumstances, but who knows how... my body would respond?~
@343=~I'm sorry, but there's already another entity inside me and it's crowded in here.~
@344=~All right! I'm sorry. I will... try not to bother you with this anymore.~
@345=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>... but I feel guilty about this, like I have forced you into something. I think it might be best if you tell me when you are ready and I will try not to bring it up so much.~
@346=~How could you think that? <CHARNAME>, I love you, and we have seen so much and done so much together. If you really believe that I feel that way, then I am clearly doing something wrong.~
@347=~I've changed my mind. Just... let me hold you tonight, until you fall asleep. I think that would be the best thing for both of us. I don't fear you at all, or find you ugly inside. You are beautiful, and you are the one I love.~
@348=~I knew you were. And I really think we are ready for this.~
@349=~All right, Kelsey. Please, be gentle.~
@350=~Absolutely. Get over here.~
@351=~Yes. Shut up, already. (kiss Kelsey)~
@352=~I need to feel more than just that I won't kill you, though. Soon, my love, but not now.~
@353=~Mmmmmmmph! Mmmmmmm...~
@354=~... all right, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps you can tell me when you feel more ready.~
@355=~I love you... good night.~
@356=~I... heh... ~
@357=~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I don't mean to laugh, it's just that...there are worse ways for a man to die than knowing that he... mmmm....~
@358=~Yes. Anyway. Well... I really want to take that chance, <CHARNAME>. There are enough things to be frightened of in our lives. Let's be brave.~
@359=~All right, Kelsey. Please, be gentle.~
@360=~Absolutely. Get over here.~
@361=~Yes. Shut up, already. (kiss Kelsey)~
@362=~I need to feel more than just that I won't kill you, though. Soon, my love, but not now.~
@363=~It's not quite the same thing... but that may never change, <CHARNAME>! Are you truly saying that you can't... love me, because you are the daughter of Bhaal and his essence is with you?~
@364=~No... that doesn't make much sense, does it? I was just afraid, but I am ready for this step with you, Kelsey.~
@365=~It's too confusing. I need more time to think about this.~

@366=~I don't want to believe it... and I DON'T believe it... but maybe...~ [FWKL2527]
@367=~No, Kelsey, listen--~
@368=~I KNOW they were lying... that was not my father, that was not Gorion... but the best liars know to start with a seed of truth.~ [FWKL2528]
@369=~Is it true? It would explain so much... honestly, it makes more sense, it has more closure to just say that yes, I did it, I caused my father's death!~ [FWKL2529]
@370=~If you're looking for help with beating yourself up, count me out.~
@371=~I don't know. I doubt you did, however.~
@372=~I don't know. Maybe you did, but it wasn't your fault.~
@373=~Those creatures tried to trick you, to hurt you. We destroyed them, don't let them win now.~
@374=~I--I only want to take responsibility, if I am truly responsible. It's... it's what my father would expect of me.~
@375=~I never truly believed it. It seemed so outrageous, but now I cannot be sure.~
@376=~Didn't you hear them, or hear me? Yes, they wanted to hurt, but sometimes the truth is what hurts the worst!~
@377=~When I think of how it happened, all those years ago... I cannot help but wonder if I missed something, some sign that should have told me that my father was the price of my spellcasting.~
@378=~Or perhaps I did see it, and I have blocked it out, chosen to forget...~
@379=~This is pointless. Even if you were somehow responsible, what then?~
@380=~I think you have dwelled on this long enough to know whether you are being honest with yourself.~
@381=~Kelsey, love, it was all lies. ALL of it.~
@382=~Then... then I would know that I am not really the person I think I am... that I was not just innocently granted these powers, but I took and hurt and... and killed my own father, just to keep them.~
@383=~And it would mean that everything... everything I blamed Birinar and my mother for was truly my own doing. I don't know if I would want to be that person.~
@384=~You are not that person, Kelsey. Those things were not your fault.~
@385=~This is ridiculous. You are punishing yourself for some creature's lies!~
@386=~You clearly need to think this over, you are not making any sense.~
@387=~I want to believe that you are right, <CHARNAME>. I think I'm just a little too shaky to think straight.~
@388=~I... will be fine, in a moment.~
@389=~It makes sense to me, damn you! Why--?~
@390=~... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. You didn't do anything to deserve that... please, forgive me.~
@391=~I hope I have.~
@392=~(sigh) Perhaps you're right. But it seemed so real... I know you were taken in as well, at least at first.~
@393=~I know I've talked to you about this... I have played those last few weeks of his life over and over in my head. Like I said, it doesn't seem right that I could have been responsible, but what is "right" about the things I can do?~
@394=~It satisfied some others to say that I killed him, because it was the easiest explanation... nothing else explained his death.~
@395=~This is... this is getting repetitive, and getting us nowhere. Thank you for helping me see things a little more clearly, <CHARNAME>.~

@396=~I know that not everything I have said lately has made sense, but...do you mind if I think out loud about you again?~ [FWKL2530]
@397=~If you insist.~
@398=~I love to listen to your thoughts, Kelsey.~
@399=~This is not a good time for me to chat.~
@400=~Understood, <CHARNAME>.~
@401=~When I think about you, and how I've seen you handle all of the adversity thrown at you... I just want you to know that I am very impressed. I am proud of you.~ [FWKL2531]
@402=~I think you really are who you want yourself to be. Despite every situation you have been forced into, every time you have been singled out, placed on the defensive, I don't think you have let anybody tell you who you should be, or what you should become.~ [FWKL2532]
@403=~Hah! Try telling that to the Solar, maybe it will leave me alone.~
@404=~What brought this on?~
@405=~I don't see how you can say that.~
@406=~I don't see how you can say that.~
@407=~I will not truly be myself until I have taken the power that's coming to me.~
@408=~Kelsey, it seems like every day I kill someone I just met. You think that is who I truly want to be?~
@409=~I will not pretend that I understand everything the Solar talks about, but I think it... she... whatever, has been saying the same thing.~
@410=~Right now, you are making your own decisions. I have no idea how that plays out cosmically--although I can guess--but even though you are being forced to make some difficult choices, I know it's you.~
@411=~It's not Bhaal, it's not Gorion or your memory of him. It's you.~
@412=~Just from spending time with you. We have been through quite a lot together. I've seen you put through things no one should ever have to face, but you have remained true to yourself.~
@413=~Why shouldn't I? You clearly do not live your life like a goddess of murder, so I don't believe Bhaal is controlling you.~
@414=~And although I did not know Gorion, something tells me that you do what you do for your own reasons, not to continue whatever crusades he might have fought.~
@415=~No, <CHARNAME>. You have made your own life.~
@416=~I can't say that you have always made the choices I would have made. I can't say there weren't other opportunities to do better by people. But you have to be you, and I respect that.~
@417=~Whatever has made you make those choices, I don't believe that it is the Bhaal essence, or some resentment towards Bhaal or Gorion or Sarevok.. you have done what YOU felt was important, or necessary.~
@418=~... I don't want to believe it, but I suppose I can believe that you want that--no, that you THINK you want to inherit everything Bhaal was.~
@419=~But I still say there is more to you, and that who you have chosen to be is stronger than what Bhaal wanted you to be, or what you think you can become at his "expense."~
@420=~You have led us here, not a prophecy or the Bhaal hunters or the other Bhaalspawn. Who can doubt that you're more than a match for them, anyway?~
@421=~I'm sorry, love... that's really not what I meant. I know that... that serving violence is not what you truly want from your life. But we both know that you cannot run, that the fights are coming to us and... and they have to be finished.~
@422=~What I am saying is that, despite the fighting, I think you have remained true to the person within you. You have had to make decisions that no one should have to face.~
@423=~But the fighting doesn't define you. You do.~
@424=~That's really special, <CHARNAME>. Even most "normal" people can't say that about themselves.~
@425=~Who do you think you are to tell me what I am or am not like?~
@426=~A very sweet thought from a very sweet fellow.~
@427=~Flatterer.~
@428=~I don't agree. It's crowded in my head.~

@429=~In a way, I think it's my job to know you better than you can know yourself.~
@430=~Well, I feel like a puppet on a string, smart guy.~
@431=~You don't know me at all. You are in for a real surprise when I realize my destiny.~
@432=~Perhaps you are right.~
@433=~I am your friend, <CHARNAME>... and I love you, and I know you, and maybe it's my job to know you better than you can know yourself.~
@434=~Just let me do my job and love you, that's all I ask.~
@435=~You make me smile, <CHARNAME>.~
@436=~I am truly sorry that you feel that way. I wish I could tell you how to make that feeling go away. All I can do is say that I see you differently.~
@437=~I hope you are wrong. In fact, I will go so far as to say that I am almost sure you are wrong. I think you will surprise yourself.~

@438=~Of all the things we have seen together... I may remember Saradush the most. So helpless... all of them. And, ultimately, so were we.~ [FWKL2533]
@439=~Yaga-Shura had the tactical advantage. We did well to defeat him regardless.~
@440=~I know... if only we could have been there sooner, perhaps we could have saved more lives.~
@441=~Not everyone died, Kelsey, and they surely would have had we not intervened. Lighten up!~
@442=~I certainly wasn't helpless! I won! And took one step nearer my goal!~
@443=~Oh, of course. I haven't lost touch with reality, <CHARNAME>... in a fair fight, or even a pretty unfair fight, you and I can take on virtually anyone and win.~
@444=~It would be nice to think so, wouldn't it? Still mostly horrible, but a little bit nice.~
@445=~You're right. We played our part, we saved what was left to be saved.~
@446=~We really did our best, <CHARNAME>. We have nothing to be ashamed of. You called the shots, and we did everything right, as usual.~
@447=~But still...the thing that truly bothers me is that when I think about everything that happened, everything we saw... I just can't make myself be more upset.~
@448=~Because this is exactly what I expected to happen. When we got to Saradush, when we saw the situation, I expected these people to die. I knew we could beat Yaga-Shura, but I knew they would die, regardless.~
@449=~This destiny is playing out, and there is no room for innocent bystanders. And I hate that, <CHARNAME>. I hate that everywhere we go, until that Solar tells us that it is all over, we will meet people who will be dragged into oblivion by a destiny that isn't even theirs!~
@450=~You bastard! Are you blaming ME for Saradush?~
@451=~I did not ask for this life, Kelsey. I thought I could count on your support, but if you can only guilt me, I don't need you.~
@452=~What can I do? I can't even go home and go to bed and wait it out, Kelsey, I have no home! This is all I know!~
@453=~I feel for every life lost here. I would appreciate you not making this harder on me.~
@454=~I suppose it did. I suppose... with the glimpses you have seen, of what you could become... is that truly all that matters to you now? The big payoff of Bhaal's power at the end of all the bloodshed?~
@455=~Sounds good to me. Are you in?~
@456=~Of course not. My goal is to be rid of these endless battles, so that we can have a life together.~
@457=~Don't put words in my mouth.~
@458=~Not... the way you think. No.~
@459=~No! I know you didn't ask for any of this.~
@460=~I know that none of it is your fault... and I think I know what kind of person you are inside, and that this must bother you more than me.~
@461=~I know that none of it is your fault... and while we may not agree on everything, I know this bothers you as well.~
@462=~...I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am not trying to make this worse for you. I said that we shouldn't be ashamed and I meant it. You really tried. I know you did. And I am sorry that people may never truly appreciate how much you wanted it to be different.~
@463=~I know that! Do you know how badly I want to be able to take you away from this? To make sure that you are never hunted again, never need risk your life again, never kill again?~
@464=~I should admit... I'm worried about Kelvim and Mirena. I didn't see them in the refugee groups... I don't know if I could handle knowing that my brother was turning out to be a great person, only to lose him like this.~
@465=~I think... I don't know what to think.~
@466=~We didn't see them among the bodies either, Kelsey. You should have faith.~
@467=~If you wanted to help the search parties, I would not mind. It looks like they could use a sound head among them.~
@468=~Honestly, you seemed to care so little for him before, what does it matter now? Admit it, you are hot for Mirena!~
@469=~I, too, hope that they are safe.~
@470=~It has been a hard day... and I am sorry for making it harder. If only we could be perfect...but then, we would not be people anymore.~
@471=~What we saw today should never be forgotten, but what we tried to do is just as important.~
@472=~I want you to know that, no matter what happens, I love you. You have always been, and will always be, my favorite heroine.~
@473=~What else can I do?~
@474=~Actually, there is something. I will arrange to have word sent back to my mother... update her, see if she knows anything. It may not be exactly what Kelvim would want, but it is better than nothing. And hopefully she will be able to find them.~
@475=~<CHARNAME>! How could you be jealous of anyone, after everything we have been through together? I am only for you. I would have thought you would know that by now.~
@476=~Hope does seem to be the best we can do...~
@477=~You may be right. I had given some thought to getting more involved, but I knew we had to move on.~
@478=~I don't want to abandon you, <CHARNAME>. I want to be there to help you. But you are right, these people are pretty disorganized.~
@479=~Go, Kelsey. I will be able to look after myself for a time. You do the same, and see if you can't help these people.~
@480=~Now that I think about it, it is best if we stay together. I don't want to lose you to tetanus or something stupid.~
@481=~I will. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I will find you when things have settled down here... count on it. Until then, be safe, and remember that I love you.~
@482=~All right, my love. I am sure they will do their best here.~

@483=~I would like to talk to you about the future. The Solar is making her convoluted sales pitch... but I want a chance to tell you what my offer is, so to speak. And I won't be vague and make you fight a room full of beasts, either.~ [FWKL2534]
@484=~You are so romantic when you talk business, Kelsey.~
@485=~Good. I would like to hear something more friendly and inviting.~
@486=~All right, but you should know that I like where she's taking me.~
@487=~I think it best if we considered our relationship part of the past.~
@488=~There is a lot waiting for you without me, is that it? If... if that is what you really want, then who am I to stop you?~
@489=~It really was a good pitch, though, <CHARNAME>. You should have heard it...~
@490=~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. Habit. And I'm nervous.~
@491=~I hope this qualifies.~
@492=~In fact, I know it does. You are my best friend, and I am definitely inviting you. For... a lot of things.~
@493=~Please, just give me a chance, <CHARNAME>.~
@494=~First... and I can't believe I even managed to keep this a secret this long... before we left Suldanesselar, I managed to take advantage of the generally good feelings about us, and I got a message... a transaction, really... out of the city.~
@495=~You, my favorite heroine, are looking at the new owner of a beautiful 15-acre villa just outside Berdusk. The house could fit all of us with room to spare, and the land is enough room for horses, for a training camp, for running around... whatever you want.~
@496=~I know that Berdusk is not the social center of the world, but the villa is gorgeous, and a good deal closer to your old home than Tethyr. It's also friendlier than Amn, at least in my mind. The people in the hamlet are very kind.~
@497=~It belonged to an old colleague, Linnea Ethander, who trades the Riatavin-Ormath route.~
@498=~She used to tease me that she would sell it to me if I would only ask, but of course I never thought I'd earn enough to own such a thing. We've done quite well for ourselves, and I have been saving, and I wanted to invest in our future... together.~
@499=~I want to build a life with you, but I respect that you may have a totally different vision of the coming years for yourself. I hope that you will meet me halfway, and consider at least using it as... a base of operations, if not a permanent home, for a time.~ [FWKL2535]
@500=~You... you did that for us? For me? Kelsey, that's wonderful!~
@501=~I had been making a life in Baldur's Gate before Irenicus waylaid me. It feels more like home to me than a place I've never been.~
@502=~I really can't imagine being tied down to one place like that.~
@503=~I would love to see it, Kelsey, but there is so much to do first...~
@504=~I don't know what to say!~
@505=~I hoped you would be excited, <CHARNAME>. It's a lot to ask, I know, but I think you will love it there.~
@506=~I thought that might be the case... and perhaps I should have talked to you before I made the decision, but it was such an opportunity...~
@507=~I hope that you will at least come see it, and perhaps we can take a season there every year if you approve. I can always rent it out, if you do not.~
@508=~I know. I know, my love. The house won't go anywhere...it will wait for us.~
@509=~Your smile is enough.~
@510=~Wherever we wind up... in Berdusk, back in Baldur's Gate, in a strange pocket plane... it's most important to me that we are together.~ [FWKL2536]
@511=~For a while, I truly thought that there could be nothing better than what you and I shared. Closeness, intimacy, a commitment both spoken and unspoken... I love everything about you, and you love me, and I didn't feel like there could be more.~ [FWKL2537]
@512=~I did not exactly have fond feelings about marriage. Maybe it was the idea of turning love into a business contract, or the way my mother distanced herself from my father's death... or just never meeting anyone truly special before you.~ [FWKL2538]
@513=~But there is much more... you... you deserve so much more, <CHARNAME>. And I got over myself and realized that if all of the marriages in the world were bad, it would not matter, because we can do it right. I know we can.~ [FWKL2539]
@514=~I want to be your husband.... I want you to be my wife... I want us to have a home and a life together. Please... please, say you will marry me.~ [FWKL2540]
@515=~(tearfully) I will, Kelsey.~
@516=~I was hoping you would ask me. Of course I will, I love you!~
@517=~Took you long enough! Yes!~
@518=~Kelsey, there are too many unanswered questions for me to make that promise to you now. It is unfair, to both of us. Let's discuss this later.~
@519=~Marriage does not sound like me. Let's just enjoy what we have for now.~
@520=~Thank you. Thank you... oh, <CHARNAME>, I am sorry I did not say something sooner. It was stupid of me not to show you how much I care about you.~
@521=~Please don't cry... even if it's for happiness, it will make me lose it too...~
@522=~I love you too. And thank you... I wish I had said something sooner. But it's never too late to start.~
@523=~(laughs) I'm sorry! I had to make sure it was right for me. There's nothing worse than making a proposal and having to back down later, and I wanted it to be special. And it will be, because you are.~
@524=~...damn, I wish so much I could make Bhaal and the Solar and everything else go away, so we could make a decision just between us!~
@525=~(sigh) But I know you have responsibilities. And those questions. But when you look for the answers, please remember that I love you, and I want to marry you.~
@526=~I... understand, <CHARNAME>. I... let's just talk about something else, later.~
@527=~(Kelsey chokes off a sob)~
@528=~I have been toying with an engagement ring, for you. I hope you like it.~
@529=~Please, take this ring... as a promise, and a reminder.~
@530=~I tried to make the ring help you feel the way you make me feel... I tried to make it reflect our love.~
@531=~You mean everything to me, <CHARNAME>. I can never show it in a ring or a home or words, but you do, you mean everything to me.~
@532=~(Kelsey holds you tightly, and buries his head in your shoulder)~
@533=~Please...please, let it be forever for us.~ [FWKL2541]

@534=~People say that "having" is not as rewarding as "wanting." In business, we count on it.~ [FWKL2542]
@535=~But it's not the same when I think about you. I wanted us to be in love, and we are, and it keeps getting better. It's... fun.~ [FWKL2590]
@536=~You always know just what to say, Kelsey.~
@537=~That's sweet. I feel the same way.~
@538=~Relax. I know you love me. You don't have to keep telling me every five minutes.~
@539=~I am not just saying it. I mean it.~
@540=~Of course, things are a little different between us than they were when we first met. The first time I held your hand... my pulse must have doubled. The first time you laid your head on my chest... I figured my life might be complete.~
@541=~Now, I take those things for granted, just a little, and my heart doesn't have to work as hard. But I love you more, just for becoming that comfortable, that close to me.~
@542=~You mean I can't quicken your pulse any more?~
@543=~You have made me more comfortable than anyone else ever could.~
@544=~I love you too, Kelsey. I don't know what else to say.~
@545=~Sure you can. Come see me after you assign the watch this evening, and I'll show you exactly how much.~
@546=~I'm glad.~
@547=~I never want you to doubt that you have a friend, and someone who will look out for you no matter what.~
@548=~That's all I need to hear.~
@549=~I think you should hear it. I know you know, but you should know that I'm not going to stop. Nothing will ever make me stop loving you, or telling you about it, or enjoying it.~
@550=~It's not just looking at you, or touching you, or hearing your voice, or kissing you... it's everything about you. What can I say? Doesn't it make you feel good, as well, believing that things will just get better with time?~
@551=~It truly is a wonderful thought.~
@552=~It is difficult... to put that much faith, and that much pressure, on one person.~
@553=~It makes me feel good, but let's just see how life unfolds without all these expectations.~
@554=~But that's the thing. There is no pressure on just one of us. Our relationship is our responsibility, and I think we're doing just fine without trying too hard.~
@555=~<CHARNAME>, I have no expectations. I know that there are things we cannot control.~
@556=~But we have so much going for us, here and now... and I hope that you see it, and appreciate it, as I do.~

@557=~I have to confess to you... I have been thinking about the choices you have to make, and what I have to offer instead, and I want you to hear it.~ [FWKL2543]
@558=~I want to marry you, give you a chance to just be yourself, and give you a house and a family if you want.~ [FWKL2544]
@559=~But there are so many... different possibilities, locked inside you, and now you can have them. And while it won't... it won't be as good as...~ [FWKL2545]
@560=~Damn! I want so badly to sell you on the idea that I am better than divinity and immortality and power, but it feels dishonest, and I don't want you to stay with me for a lie, for less than you know you want for yourself!~ [FWKL2546]
@561=~Good choice. I care for you, Kelsey, but I am going to have to make my decision based on more than just what you would have of me.~
@562=~As much as I can, Kelsey, I will consider everything that my friends and my loved ones mean to me, especially you.~
@563=~I love you and I don't want to leave you. I promise you that we will have a long, happy life together.~
@564=~The power won't change me. It could be the best thing for me.~
@565=~I promised to marry you, and I keep my promises, Kelsey. I will be here for you, always.~
@566=~I promised to marry you, what more do you need to hear from me?~
@567=~Even if I become something more than I am, Kelsey, it may not be the end for us.~
@568=~Then perhaps I do need to give you a loving sales pitch, after all! (Kelsey rubs his hands together playfully)~
@569=~I love you, too, and... thank you. I just need you to know how I feel, <CHARNAME>. Let me explain...~
@570=~I know, and I don't think you lied, but sooner or later you will have to choose between that wedding date and something very, very different, and I want you to know what I think the choice really is.~
@571=~I have not forgotten, <CHARNAME>, and I will never forget. But I would hate for you to remember, later, that you did not consider everything staying with me and being my wife will mean.~
@572=~Are you sure? Look at the Solar. She speaks and looks like a woman... sort of... but she is something totally other. And you would be greater, more powerful and more... other, than she.~
@573=~Do you really think someone like her would "flail the bladder" with Korgan some hot, sticky evening? Join Minsc for a plate of roast beef and a beer and a chat about the good old days?~
@574=~Is the nice bright lady joining us for dinner? Boo will be happy to make room at the table!~
@575=~She may be long-limbed and godly, but she's a fit wench all the same. I'll gladly introduce her to me "flail" for a bit o' worship-the-teacher!~
@576=~I believe we have distastefully but predictably stumbled upon Korgan's epitaph. (sigh)~
@577=~I'm not going to pretend that I know what the Solar or whomever has in mind for you. And she is very pretty, that Solar. If she were more direct in her speech, she could sell steak to a fishmonger. But if you have stayed with me this long, you are a lady who isn't sold by looks alone.~
@578=~You can have an eternity looking over your shoulder at other jealous celestial beings, half of whom wrongly suspect you're another Bhaal, and the other half who are so sick they only wish you were. I know to expect more from my favorite heroine, but there you have it.~
@579=~And there will be prayers to answer and miracles to perform and celestial backstabbings to dodge.~
@580=~And nobody will cook for you because you won't feel like eating, and nobody will rub your feet because you won't get sore. That sounds great, but the thing about pleasure is that it's always better when it wipes away pain and discomfort. Eating is fun, because being hungry isn't.~
@581=~I know it may not have shown on the road, but I am actually not a bad cook, when well motivated and well supplied. I've been told I use too much tarragon. I can try to stop, for you.~
@582=~And I will rub any part of you, on demand, for as long as necessary.~
@583=~And I will do it until I die. Not because I fear you or want power from you and worship you, but because I love you, and I want to keep loving you.~
@584=~Whatever lies at the other side, as you looked upon your time with me, it would seem as an adult sees her time with a childhood pet or toddler playmate. Going back to visit them... would never feel the same, or mean the same thing.~ [FWKL2547]
@585=~And no, it's not good sales tactics to tell you that I am like an animal or a small child compared to what you could become. That's because I have to be honest with you, and hope that you can be honest and understanding with me.~ [FWKL2548]
@586=~That's... all I have, <CHARNAME>.~ [FWKL2549]
@587=~I didn't need to be convinced again, Kelsey, but... thank you for caring enough to be so open and honest. It means a lot.~
@588=~You have not lost your way with words, being my sorcerer lover instead of an accountant. I promise you, we will not be separated.~
@589=~(remain silent)~
@590=~Kelsey... I don't know how to say this, but you have really made godhood sound very appealing. I think you're wrong about some things.~
@591=~You deserve it. You have earned it, and you deserve it.~
@592=~I believe you, <CHARNAME>. I really, really do.~
@593=~(sigh) Then you were already convinced before I started. I cannot change who I am or how I feel about you. I can only keep watching, and waiting, and hoping.~

@594=~Hey, Kelsey... I don't remember giving you permission to be in our little gang, here. So we gotta talk.~
@595=~Oh, I'm sorry, did I forget to fill out a form or something?~ [FWKL2550]
@596=~As a matter of fact, yes, you did. But I suppose <CHARNAME>'s really to blame. I left specific instructions that <PRO_HESHE> shouldn't hang around with anybody who wasn't a bad influence.~
@597=~I mean... let's face it, Kelsey, you're a stiff. You try to hide it, but you're booooring. Booooring...~
@598=~Oh. So I don't rate on the Imoen T. Bhaalspawn Naughty-Meter, is that what you're saying?~
@599=~Yeah! Now, see, that wasn't boring, that was kinda funny. Why can't you be kinda funny more often?~
@600=~Maybe I'm just not feeling inspired more often.~
@601=~Inspired? Day in and day out, you're with one of the absolutely most fascinatingest people in the world. Oh, and <CHARNAME>, who isn't bad <PRO_HIMHER>self either.~
@602=~And I think it's time you started pulling your weight around here in non-boringness.~
@603=~Or else?~
@604=~Or else Imoen T. Bhaalspawn is gonna make some serious changes to the scenery around here. You're on probation, mister.~

@605=~Hey, Imoen?~ [FWKL2551]
@606=~Yeah, Kelsey?~
@607=~How many of your rules am I breaking today?~
@608=~Ummm, just one so far. It turns out that you're violating Section 3J, which says that <CHARNAME> shall keep no companions that I could beat at arm-wrestling.~
@609=~Oh yeah? Imoen, how the heck did you ever manage to steal anything? If somebody caught you, they could probably snap you in half with one hand.~
@610=~I wouldn't know, I'm so quick I never get caught with MY pants down. Unlike you, that night when you woke up and wandered off to take a leak.~
@611=~You... you saw... uh, I mean, no you didn't, that wasn't me.~
@612=~Oh yeah, that behind had "Kelsey" written all over it. I made real sure to capture it in my mind's eye. It's... a hobby of mine. I MIGHT scribe a special scroll to add to my private collection, but I'm really not sure it rates.~
@613=~Magical ink is great stuff. Permanent, and captures a lot of detail, too. Let's face it, I doubt I could get rich selling it, though... like I said, you're kind of a pushover and that shows up in the strangest places on a fellow.~
@614=~But I might share. Want me to make you a copy, Nalia?~
@615=~Hardly... leave me out of this, I have more important things to think about.~
@616=~(sigh) No one is safe from you, are they?~
@617=~Nope. My bad side is a dangerous place to be! And your backside is, well...~
@618=~Whatever it is, don't say it.~
@619=~How about if I just whisper it? No, it'll be an unfinished spell I will leave hanging in the air... Power Word: Embarrass Kelsey.~
@620=~Imoen... I... aaargh.~
@621=~Hee hee!~

@622=~Hey, Kelsey?~
@623=~Yes, Imoen?~ [FWKL2552]
@624=~I like my new name, but what did the "T" in "Imoen T. Bhaalspawn" stand for, anyway? I don't have a middle name, not that I know of, anyway.~
@625=~Oh. Uh, it stood for "The," I think. It was the best I could do on short notice.~
@626=~That was the best you could do? Not "Terrible" or "Terrifying" or "Triumphant" or even "Tina"?~
@627=~Sorry. Just stick with the initial and don't tell people what it stands for. It will be more mysterious that way.~
@628=~You ARE an archmage, after all, so I think the rules say you have to start getting used to being mysterious. And "Tina" isn't mysterious anyway.~
@629=~Or I could tell them that they CAN'T know because knowing my true archmagestress name would let them conjure with it! Yeah, that's it! Hey, you come up with some pretty swell ideas to save your initially lame ideas, Kelsey!~
@630=~Wow, with compliments like that...~
@631=~Aww, cheer up. You take things too seriously. How did you ever go around selling brushes door-to-door with such thin skin?~
@632=~I wasn't a door-to-door salesman, I--~
@633=~See, there you go again. Sheesh. Have you always been a slow learner?~
@634=~Hey! I beg your pardon, I think I--~
@635=~Ahah! Gotcha again! You are making this way too easy, Kelsey. I thought <CHARNAME> was an easy mark, but you are WAY more fun.~
@636=~Well, you better watch out, because I AM a quick learner, and I'm watching the way you operate, missy.~
@637=~Oooh! A threat! Kelsey, you're making me all tingly with anticipation. Don't let me down!~

@638=~How come you're looking so cheerful, Kelsey?~
@639=~Oh, it's nothing you want to know.~ [FWKL2553]
@640=~I want to know everything about everything, so that's a lie. And now I want to know more than ever.~
@641=~Well, I suppose there's nothing you can do about it now. Frankly, I'm surprised you didn't notice, I thought a big bad "archmagestress" like you would know when she's being watched...~
@642=~When the... you didn't...~
@643=~Yep. Me and my wizard eye watched you wash all your lacy underthings last time we took a breather.~
@644=~That shimmery thing was you? ... no, wait, you're not very good at this lying thing. Come on, tell me the truth, or more than your wizard eye will be seeing stars.~
@645=~... okay, okay, it wasn't a wizard eye, I made a harmless magic orb and sent it in your direction.~
@646=~But how... how did you know... ?~
@647=~Give a guy credit for knowing his business, at least. I could tell you had changed clothes, so I guessed. Plus, uh, I noticed you smell real nice now.~
@648=~"You smell real nice now"? Who writes your lines, anyway? You sound like a big oaf.~
@649=~Hey! You know, I don't have to tell you that you smell nice! I could tell any girl in Tethyr she smells nice, or give her a fun nickname.~
@650=~Yeah, but they would all see right through you. Me, I've already seen it, so I don't have to go through the trouble.~

@651=~Good night.~ [FWKL2554]
@652=~Good night, everybody...~
@653=~G'night, <CHARNAME>.~
@654=~Good night, Kelsey.~
@655=~Good night, Imoen.~
@656=~...~
@657=~...Kelsey, you asleep?~
@658=~Not exactly.~
@659=~Then tell me a story, oh big man of the world.~
@660=~Are you joking?~
@661=~No, I'm not joking. If I was joking I'd say "Two peanuts were walking down the street. One was assaulted... peanut."~
@662=~Or "A dire wolf, a kobold, and a succubus walk into a tavern. The barkeep says, 'Sorry, we only serve kobolds here.' And the succubus responds, 'Yeah, I know. Can you add some oregano this time?' "~
@663=~I don't... wait... hah, okay, okay, I know the difference, I know when you're joking.~
@664=~Right. So. I'm bored, tell me a story.~
@665=~Okay... hold on, I'll slide over there.~
@666=~Maybe we should keep our voices down so we don't keep anyone up.~
@667=~Ooooh, yeah. <CHARNAME> is a real beast if <PRO_HESHE> doesn't get <PRO_HISHER> beauty sleep.~
@668=~Sounds like YOU should tell ME a story.~
@669=~Well, there was this one morning back at Candlekeep...~

@670=~...there has to be a reason. I want to earn it, not just have it handed to me.~ [FWKL2555]
@671=~...and I totally feel the same way! Wow, Kelsey, we really have a lot... oh, um, top o' the mornin' to ya, <CHARNAME>.~
@672=~Er... ah... hello, <CHARNAME>.~
@673=~And just what have you two been up to, as if I didn't know?~
@674=~Did you two stay up all night?!?~
@675=~Oh, good morning. Sleep well, did you?~
@676=~It's like I told ya, Kelsey... <CHARNAME> is always so cranky in the morning.~
@677=~Not that it's your business, <PRO_LADYLORD> Conclusion-Jumper, but we were just talking.~
@678=~Did we? Oops, I suppose we did.~
@679=~Just talking, though.~
@680=~Oh, um, I think we forgot that part. We were talking, and then all of a sudden, it was later and there you were!~
@681=~Did you know Kelsey once lost all of the toenails on his right foot after a fat lady stomped on it on purpose? Or that he intends to pluck his gray hairs as soon as he gets some?~
@682=~I guess we lost track of time, <CHARNAME>.~
@683=~So I presume you're both totally useless today? Thanks.~
@684=~Did either of you think to prepare for the day's exertions?~
@685=~I know... sorry, it's my fault, I should have reminded Imoen to study her spellbook.~
@686=~My eyes glaze over some nights reading that stupid big book anyway. It's almost a shame I'm so darn good at it, I would have more excuses just to get some rest for a change.~
@687=~I suppose we were too busy... talking, to get to that part.~
@688=~Yep! Clear slipped our minds. I barely cracked that spellbook of mine. Oops.~
@689=~Anyway, you've got this all wrong, <CHARNAME>. Look at morale! It's at an all-time high from where I'm standing!~
@690=~Don't worry about us, we're as alert as can be, ready to do your big serious world-shaking bidding!~
@691=~*yawn*~
@692=~Ah! Stop that. *yawn*~
@693=~You stop it! *yawn*~

@694=~... that sounds pretty yummy, although I don't think I would like that much tarragon.~
@695=~Then we can make it together, and you put in as much as you think you want. No point in making it if you won't like it.~ [FWKL2556]
@696=~Great, it's a date! Of course, we have to wait until we're done rewriting history.~
@697=~I can wait.~
@698=~Excuse me for a minute...~
@699=~<CHARNAME>, do you have a moment? I wanted to talk to you about Imoen.~
@700=~Sure, go ahead.~
@701=~No, I want to talk to you about Imoen. I like that you two are getting along.~
@702=~No, I want to talk to YOU about Imoen. Stay away from her.~
@703=~What is there to say? You are both adults. None of my business.~
@704=~I just thought that since she values your opinion... but if that's how you feel, I agree. Sorry to bother you.~
@705=~You can probably tell that I like your sister. I like her a lot, <CHARNAME>. But I know that you two are close, and Imoen respects you more than anyone in the world.~
@706=~So I want everything to be out in the open between you and I, since we both care about her.~
@707=~It's Imoen's life to waste on you, I suppose. Whatever.~
@708=~I think it's great that you two have found each other.~
@709=~What you do on your own time is your business, but I expect you both to follow my orders, not your hormones.~
@710=~It's very simple. If you hurt her in any way, I will kill you. Slowly.~
@711=~No, this is not right. I forbid you to go on seeing her.~
@712=~Spare me the editorial, <CHARNAME>. I told you out of respect and courtesy. If you have none to return, I won't bother in future.~
@713=~Believe me, nobody's happier about this than I am. Imoen is so sweet and fun, honestly, I can't believe nobody got to her first!~
@714=~I think we both understand that, <CHARNAME>. Imoen is special to me, no matter what, but you are still the boss. I'm glad this isn't a problem for you.~
@715=~I hear you loud and clear. Even without the threats, I assure you that Imoen is very special to me and I would never dream of doing anything to hurt her.~
@716=~What? I wanted to be open with you, I did not say I was seeking your permission for anything. I'm a grown man, and Imoen may be your sister and friend but she's a grown woman and my friend, too!~
@717=~You are right, I suppose. Do as you will, as long as you remember that you are here as part of the group.~
@718=~Forgive my hasty words. If Imoen is happy, then I am happy for both of you.~
@719=~I meant what I said. Stay away from Imoen.~
@720=~If that is your final word on the subject... then I will not pursue her. For now. And I will not tell her why... for now.~
@721=~But after this adventure ends, <CHARNAME>, I will tell Imoen how I feel for her, and how you tried to stand in our way. Whether you reach godhood or not, I swear I won't let it drop so easily the next time.~
@722=~I... oh! Obviously, I like it too. And I'm glad that it won't cause any friction between us. I am not trying to get between you two in any way, but I know how much Imoen respects you... as I do.~
@723=~Anyway, thank you for your kind words. I promise you that I will be good to your sister.~

@724=~... no, I said that you were my sugar plum way earlier.~ [FWKL2557]
@725=~Yeah, but you big copycat, that was only because I called you my sweetie.~
@726=~Are you sure? I think you're making that up, honey girl. You're so cute when you lie.~
@727=~I don't think I can stand much more of this.~
@728=~Awww, you're such a flatterer, my Kelsey cream pie!~
@729=~Helm's mercy! Surely none of us have earned this torment!~
@730=~It's not flattery, it's the truth, my purple-haired princess.~
@731=~Surely, each is worthy of a lightning bolt... no, several...~
@732=~Oooh, a princess! That makes you my firey-haired manservant, all moon-eyed and ready to do my bidding.~
@733=~This sparrow begs of you both to seek out more compelling source material. Perhaps something that will not gag us all with a thick syrupy coating...~
@734=~Or the only prince that can sweep my impish Imoen off her dainty little feet.~
@735=~Give the word, <CHARNAME>, and I will gladly maim the one you name. Both, preferably.~
@736=~That sounds so nice, you cunning dollop of manliness!~
@737=~Dollop? How about I wallop both yer tongues off?~
@738=~Everything must sound nice to you, you've got the cutest ears in the world!~
@739=~I very much doubt that. You haven't seen a pair of lobes until you've seen Jangler the... what am I saying? By Scratchy's beard, you won't drag me into this!~
@740=~That's so sweet of you to notice! Did you know you have really cute calves? I could just eat them up!~
@741=~Oh, please... please, you two, can't you keep this sort of thing private?~
@742=~Not before I gobble up your dainty little fingers and toesies!~
@743=~Fascinating. I had no idea that inducing vomiting was such an important part of rivvil foreplay.~
@744=~Oooh, if you do that, I guess you will have to serve me, I'll have to depend on my Kelsey-welsey for everything!~
@745=~ENOUGH!!!!~
@746=~You are both seconds away from a beating.~
@747=~Kelsey, would you just call her Immy-wimmy and then shut up?~
@748=~Oh, sorry, were we bothering you?~
@749=~How about a truce, Imoen? I'm just about out of names for you anyway... I'd better save a few in reserve or you'll get bored with me in a hurry.~
@750=~Awww... I was just getting warmed up.~

@751=~I sure am glad I don't have to go through all this revelation and epiphany stuff.~
@752=~Really? I thought that, now that you know you're a Bhaalspawn too, you would want the same answers.~ [FWKL2558]
@753=~Nah. Who needs it? I'll just let <PRO_HIMHER> sort it all out and give me the short version.~
@754=~I can just ask for a copy of the family tree for my... birthday...~
@755=~What's wrong?~
@756=~Nothin'... just...~
@757=~What is it?~
@758=~I... you dummy, now that you've got me thinking about stuff, now I have to remember how I wish Gorion wasn't dead and I have to remember how much I miss Winthrop, too. And hope he's all right... we're really not sure what happened to him.~
@759=~You've mentioned him before... he was kind of like a second father to you, wasn't he?~
@760=~Yeah, or third father, if you count the big bad Bhaal, or whatever... I mean, I owe Gorion a lot, but Winthrop really cared about me, you know? And he was the one who always remembered my birthday.~
@761=~Actually, he didn't, but he'd always remember that at some point I should have a birthday and we'd celebrate. Occasionally, if I played my cards just right or I had a really good bit of gossip to swap with him, I could con him into two birthdays a year, and that was great, let me tell you.~
@762=~The more I could convince him to get crocked before we celebrated, the better the gifts were, usually because I could raid his pockets if I thought he was stiffing me. Those were the days...~
@763=~I haven't really talked to Winthrop since I went chasing after <CHARNAME> forever and a day ago...and meanwhile <CHARNAME> gets all this attention and a swanky little plane to <PRO_HIMHER>self, and I get to miss Winthrop and have no birthdays at all.~
@764=~How about a kiss and a big "Happy birthday", then, if today is as likely as any other day?~
@765=~Well...~
@766=~Happy birthday!~
@767=~Mmmph!~

@768=~Whatcha staring at, Kelsey? Don't tell me you can't memorize spells and you can't remember what I look like, either. Want me to draw you a picture?~
@769=~Oh, I was noticing... your eye, and I just wanted to ask you... about that scar...~ [FWKL2559]
@770=~Well, it's not polite to stare. You've got a stupid ugly nose, but I don't stare at it. Much.~
@771=~Oh, Imoen... what did they do to you?~
@772=~Nothing. They couldn't--hey, don't! Don't touch it. Don't touch me!~
@773=~I'm sorry, Imoen, I just--~
@774=~It's... it's horrible. It's horrible and I hate it and I hate you for bringing it up.~
@775=~It was Irenicus, wasn't it? When he kidnapped you and <CHARNAME>...~
@776=~Would you shut up? Shut up!~
@777=~(remain silent)~
@778=~Kelsey, I think you should back off.~
@779=~Kelsey, if you keep bothering Imoen, I will break your legs.~
@780=~<CHARNAME>... please, I think she needs to talk about this.~
@781=~Can't you see she's hurting? I'm trying to help!~
@782=~Imoen, please talk to me.~
@783=~I don't want... I don't need...~
@784=~(sob) You don't know, and you can't know. Just go 'way.~
@785=~Imoen...~
@786=~Are you deaf and stupid? GO AWAY!~

@787=~Kelsey... ummm... are you still talking to me?~
@788=~I would, if I had any idea what to say.~ [FWKL2560]
@789=~I'm really sorry I yelled at you. You're a sweet guy, I know you were only trying to help.~
@790=~No, I'm sorry. I made you feel self-conscious, and I tried to force you to talk about something you don't want to talk about.~
@791=~It's not that easy. I... I could talk to you about... what he did, but I can't say the words. Every time I think about it, I get so creeped out, I just want to scream and hide under a bed.~
@792=~And I ate so much at that award ceremony in Suldenesselar I barely fit under a bed anymore.~
@793=~Hah! Not likely.~
@794=~But seriously... Imoen, Irenicus can't hurt you anymore. He's gone. If he's still hurting you like that... you have to get it out of you, somehow. I want to help.~
@795=~I know, Kelsey... but not right now. Besides, this is really bumming me out.~
@796=~Can we start the healing process now?~
@797=~I said I don't want to talk about this right now.~
@798=~I know. I was thinking I could kiss your scar. You know, make it better.~
@799=~Ooooh! Smooth talker. Lucky for you we're not in the cavalry, you'd have to kiss my saddle sores.~
@800=~Was that a no?~
@801=~(giggle) No.~

@802=~Imoen, what are you going to do when it's time to move on?~ [FWKL2561]
@803=~I don't know. I'm hoping to keep riding this fashion trend for a while, I kinda hate having to find a new look. You've probably got the inside scoop, big businessman--ARE plunging necklines back this year?~
@804=~I didn't mean what are you going to do when you need new clothes. You know... if we survive all this. What's Imoen T. Cutest-Ever Bhaalspawn ever going to do with herself?~
@805=~Don't know. See what other trouble <CHARNAME> and I can get into, I hope. I'd like to see somebody try to mess with us now! Maybe I'll go back to Candlekeep, say a prayer for Gorion, and buy Winthrop a beer.~
@806=~Hey, maybe I'll be saying a prayer TO <CHARNAME>. That would be something, wouldn't it?~
@807=~Too weird for me to think about, actually.~
@808=~You've got your patented "Kelsey's-trying-to-hide-something-from-Imoen" look on, so you may as well just tell me, you goon.~
@809=~I don't know... I don't know! I don't know what's going to happen. With all this business eliminating Bhaalspawns going on, I don't know what's going to happen to you.~
@810=~And if it's anything other than "really good", I probably don't want it to happen to you!~
@811=~Nobody knows. What, you think I'm going to grow a third arm or a third boob or something? You might like the one and I KNOW you'd like the other.~
@812=~I'm being serious.~
@813=~So am I, you've got really wandering eyes.~
@814=~Imoen... I'm trying to tell you that I love you and I don't want anything to happen to you but it's hard to do if you keep making fun of me all the time!~
@815=~Awww. Deal with it.~
@816=~If you hold me for a minute, I promise I won't make fun of you.~
@817=~For a minute.~

@818=~Dearest, is anything troubling you? Anything we can talk about?~ [FWKL2562]
@819=~(You regard Kelsey, and realize that there will probably never be a better moment to confide in him anything which might remain unsaid between you.)~
@820=~(say nothing more)~
@821=~You have been a real asset, Kelsey, as a comrade, and as a friend. Thank you.~
@822=~I love when you smile, Kelsey. You have added so much to my life, with that alone.~
@823=~You are a sexy, sexy man, Kelsey. You have always worried about what being a sorcerer means. I'll tell you what it means. It means HOT.~
@824=~I cannot wait to get married, Kelsey!~
@825=~You call me your "favorite heroine," but truly Kelsey, you are much more the hero than I could ever be.~
@826=~Kelsey... very likely, I will outlive you. I don't know how I will go on, when you are gone...~
@827=~Kiss me, Kelsey. I want to forget everything that troubles me...~
@828=~Kelsey, I'm... afraid...~
@829=~Don't forget me, Kelsey. Promise me, no matter what happens, that you won't forget me.~
@830=~Kelsey, would you prefer a boy or a girl as our first child? We will be having at least one, and sooner than you think.~
@831=~Kelsey... I don't know exactly how to tell you this, but I... we... I... am going to have a baby.~
@832=~Oh... that... well...~ [FWKL2563]
@833=~That means, among other things, that the stuff we got from Jaheira didn't quite do the trick...~
@834=~That means, among other things, that the stuff we got from Cernd didn't quite do the trick...~
@835=~That means, among other things, that the stuff we got from Aerie didn't quite do the trick...~
@836=~S-Sorry. (grin)~
@837=~That means, among other things, that the stuff we got from Cespenar didn't quite do the trick... then again, I suppose that's not too surprising.~
@838=~So. Let's talk about this... and I have a lot of questions... so please, do not get upset or think that I am saying something that I am not...~
@839=~First of all... are you all right, <CHARNAME>? I mean, I couldn't tell...~
@840=~Kelsey, it's very early yet. I feel normal, but... I know.~
@841=~Eh, I think I'll be laying off the lard sandwiches until my tummy settles down, but yes, I am fine.~
@842=~Nothing's wrong... yet.~
@843=~The way you said that, you make it sound... magical. I like that.~
@844=~If there is anything that would make that easier for you, please tell me... you have enough on your mind!~
@845=~Good, good, that's good.~
@846=~I feel better knowing that you are well so far, but <CHARNAME>... is this safe? I know, it is a hell of a time to start wondering now, but we thought we were taking precautions...~
@847=~There is so much, between the two of us, to think about. we are not exactly normal parents. My sorcery, and you have whatever Bhaal passed on to you...~
@848=~I know. I want a normal, beautiful baby, but I am scared.~
@849=~As far as I am concerned, I am basically an ordinary woman. Neither of us is anybody's avatar, we are just people with special talents. Our baby will be fine.~
@850=~It is a mystery, but really, all babies are.~
@851=~The two of us sorcerers... our baby will certainly have some interesting advantages.~
@852=~We can get through it, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure we can. We will find people who can help.~
@853=~I truly hope so.~
@854=~You have a point. I suppose I might just well wonder if our son or daughter will be a redhead like daddy, rather than be a sorcerer like daddy! We can't change either.~
@855=~I had not quite thought of that. Who better to learn from, if the baby inherits our magic? I'm sure it will be easier than it was for you or I...~
@856=~I had been thinking about this, from time to time... wondering if it would be possible, if it would be safe for us to have children. I wish there were others we knew, that might know from experience, but there just aren't many Bhaalspawn to ask...~
@857=~It is going to take a little time, but I think I am getting over the initial shock. I love you, <CHARNAME>, and I love that we mean enough to each other that we are even having this conversation.~
@858=~Just for you to tell me--especially this early, when I did not have to know--took a lot of courage and a lot of caring, about me and about our relationship. Thank you.~
@859=~This is still not simple, though. <CHARNAME>, I know I am not telling you anything you do not know, but... there are people trying to kill us, and now... that means they are trying to kill our baby as well.~
@860=~I want--I NEED to protect you two from this!~
@861=~My objective remains the same, Kelsey. I have to meet these conflicts head-on.~
@862=~I know, love, but only victory will stop the fighting, and that is the only real safety for our child.~
@863=~We... we can't just hide for months on end, Kelsey. It won't work.~
@864=~(smiles) Well, the baby certainly does deserve to know that its mother was always true to herself. I wonder if that will mean your determined attitude will be part of him as he grows? Or she...~
@865=~It seems so unfair! But you're right, there has to be an end to this, for both of us, or all three of us...~
@866=~Hopefully he won't remember the bad things, and by time the baby is born, we can look after it the way good parents should... not lugging him around in a backpack and hoping he's immune to Horrid Wilting.~
@867=~I know! I know... if we could have, I would have hidden you long ago. It seems to have become our full-time job, fighting everyone in the world with a bad attitude... and it's getting very old.~
@868=~I am going to stand by you, and stay with you, no matter what you decide. So... Let me get to the point I have been dancing around.~
@869=~This is going to have to mean some changes for us. We can't just leave our baby with Cespenar, that's for sure! And... well, I've brought up the things that could be problems, later.~
@870=~<CHARNAME>, are you all right with this? I know it is not an easy question and it does not have an easy answer.~
@871=~It's just too scary, Kelsey... I do not think I can go through with this.~
@872=~On the whole, I think a baby would be a tremendously bad thing, and I plan to make a stop at an herb witch at my earliest convenience.~
@873=~I am frightened, but I... we, I and the baby... feel better knowing that you will be here for us.~
@874=~I think it's wonderful, Kelsey. You are the best thing that's ever happened to me, and the baby will be the best thing that ever happened for both of us, together.~
@875=~We will learn what it means to be parents. It will be an important part of growing up, for both of us.~
@876=~I... I want you to please think about that, a little more. I know that we could have planned this better, but I really think it could be a good experience. A good way to start a new life together.~
@877=~If things were calmer... I would fight you on this, I think. But that would be insane.~
@878=~If your decision is final, I respect it. I will not ask you to sacrifice or compromise your life, if it is not what you want.~
@879=~It makes me happy to know that you trust in me like that. I could have understood, the way you came into the world, not feeling much love for a father-to-be. So I understand you being afraid, but please remember... I would never abandon you.~
@880=~I will always be here for you, <CHARNAME>, and for anyone else we happen to bring into the world.~
@881=~You saying so does a lot to make me feel like this is a lucky thing, rather than a... surprise. I think we have both learned a lot from our families, enough to be good parents, if we try.~
@882=~I think you're right. It will be good to work for the good of a family and have it really mean something again. I hear that parents learn as much from their kids as the other way around.~
@883=~We will make a different life, so that the baby can learn more than tactics, spell protection counters, and field bandaging...~
@884=~(Kelsey kisses you gently) I love you, <CHARNAME>. Not because of babies or love-making. Just because of you.~ [FWKL2564]
@885=~Of course I will never forget you! How could I? Besides, there is so much for us to live for.~
@886=~I have never told you this, Kelsey, but if I fall in battle, it will definitely mean the end for us... for me. I saw it happen to Sarevok, it will happen to me, I know it.~
@887=~Anything can happen, Kelsey, and I just want to hear you say it.~
@888=~But... with our resources, we could surely have you raised if something--~
@889=~No, you don't understand. The Bhaal essence... it will eat me up... I will disintegrate, blow away in the wind. I tell you, it happened to Sarevok, it would happen to me.~
@890=~I... I don't know what to say. I was never going to feel good about the idea of you dying in battle. I have certainly seen many more people die once and forever than I've seen them come back.~
@891=~That is... good to know, if anything like that could be "good." Thank you for telling me, but... I hope I never have to really know what you mean.~
@892=~I promise you... I swear to you, <CHARNAME>, no matter what happens, I will always know you, and remember you, and love you.~
@893=~(Kelsey takes you by the hand and squeezes, a little too hard.)~
@894=~Don't be.~
@895=~Don't laugh... this is not easy for me to say, I am not used to thinking of myself as more than comfortably above average as a trader and reluctantly good with fireballs. But we really do not need to be afraid.~
@896=~You are the strongest leader I have ever known. You may be the strongest leader in the world. I know that it is not easy, and it's... kind of cute that you still actually fear things occasionally. But we will handle any challenge or treachery they throw at us.~
@897=~And we will handle... whatever lies at the end of your destiny. Together. I know we will. Hold my hand, and you will believe that it's true. Now... what was there to be afraid of, again?~
@898=~Everything.~
@899=~Nothing, Kelsey, you're right.~
@900=~Aside from being smote by the gods, slaughtered in my sleep, or losing you to some barmaid with a nice rack and a round behind... gee, nothing comes to mind.~
@901=~(say nothing more about this)~
@902=~Heh. Don't worry, <CHARNAME>. I worry by nature, and I'm only a little more worried than I'm admitting.~
@903=~See?~
@904=~Dear, you know that I'm a <CHARNAME> man. And not only because I worry about being smote or slaughtered in my sleep if I get caught with a barmaid.~
@905=~(Wordlessly, Kelsey takes you by the hips. As he pulls you forward, your lips meet, and the warmth spreads quickly through your body.)~
@906=~(Just as you begin to taste his salt and feel the scrape of what passes for his stubble, you forget--but just for that moment--that you had even asked for the kiss.)~
@907=~I know, <CHARNAME>. I hope that you have a long, healthy, safe life... but I know that means you could easily double my age, or more.~
@908=~You will just be coming into the prime of your life when I am in my decline. I almost want to apologize for that right now, but it seems so silly, with the future so... well, so far in the future!~
@909=~We will still have plenty of time to grow and learn from one another, <CHARNAME>. Although...~
@910=~I know, <CHARNAME>. I hope that you have a long, healthy, safe life... but I know that means centuries, perhaps millenia. I remember being a boy, yet I know that I am not far from the halfway mark, so to speak. You might live hundreds of years longer.~
@911=~I know, <CHARNAME>. I hope that you have a long, healthy, safe life... but I know that means centuries, perhaps millenia. I remember being a boy, yet I know that I am not far from the halfway mark, so to speak. It's not the same for you... this is almost nothing compared to the rest of your life.~
@912=~I admit, sometimes my mind wanders and I worry, just a little bit, that I will some day be a distant memory in the life of a beautiful lady...~
@913=~No! Kelsey, I could NEVER forget you!~
@914=~I wish there was something we could do, but the options are... not good.~
@915=~I believe you, honey. And I know that you will go on. I think... I think what will be harder for both of us than the hundreds of years after... my death, will be the years leading up to it. You'll still be beautiful and young, and I will... not.~
@916=~Kelsey, I would love nothing more than to present you with a youthful face every morning for the rest of your life. You have certainly earned that much.~
@917=~It is, unfortunately, what happens when we come together with humans. The alternatives to try to extend our life together are dangerous. I hate that.~
@918=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I promise you that your face will be the one I see, for the rest of my life. No matter what happens.~
@919=~(Kelsey smiles, a bit sadly) I hate it too, my love. And yes... I don't want to wind up a lich, or like Irenicus, or cursed by the gods for trying to be more than I am...~
@920=~You know, I have often wondered about... well, wished for, really, being half-elven. It would have explained so much... elven heritage would make it easier to understand why I was a sorcerer. And I'd get to live longer, see more of the world...~
@921=~And now... now I know it would let me spend more years with you.~
@922=~But your humanity is one of the things I love about you, Kelsey. Don't wish to be anything that you are not.~
@923=~(crying) Damn... it is so unfair!~
@924=~We will do everything we can to make the years we have the best ANY couple could have.~
@925=~You make it compelling to just be myself, but it is so easy to want more time with you.~
@926=~Other humans say "Wouldn't you get bored around the hundredth year?" ... I never really bought that, and it's even worse now that we're together.~
@927=~But you're right. This is what we have, and there is nothing you could offer me to regret meeting you when I did, how I did, and why I did.~
@928=~(Kelsey holds you and strokes your hair gently) Please don't cry, <CHARNAME>... it IS unfair, but we have a long time together by any measure if we just keep looking out for one another.~
@929=~I... I hate it too. Shhhh... let's try not to hold it against each other or against the world.~
@930=~I know we will. As long as we stay together, and don't lose sight of why we love each other. I would be lying if I said I don't want it to last longer.~
@931=~But... it really is all a gift, and we should remember that. Wanting more is healthy, of course.~
@932=~The most important thing to remember is that you will go on, <CHARNAME>... you will be your wonderful self after I am gone, because that's what you do--you keep going, no matter what happens or who tries to stop you.~
@933=~And if you meet... well. You will not stop being a loving person after I'm gone. But... let's talk about something else.~
@934=~That's... really nice of you to say, but I'm sure you have known "hotter" men in your day. Not that I want you to go find them again, of course.~ [FWKL2565]
@935=~Knock it off. Listen. You are the most magnificent specimen of masculinity in the world. You have charm, you have power, you have a good head on your shoulders. EVERY woman should want you but only *I* can have you! I LOVE THAT!~
@936=~(say nothing more about this)~
@937=~(Kelsey begins to nervously shift from foot to foot... apparently he's never been told anything remotely like this before.)~
@938=~You are the only one I want, so it's a lucky thing--~
@939=~I haven't finished, Kelsey. All that worrying about what being a sorcerer is about is dumb. It means you can protect me--which makes me feel VERY warm inside--and it means you can blow things up, which is very impressive and makes me clap my hands and giggle like a little girl. I love that.~
@940=~I think I'll just listen quietly until you're done... although I still say you must be looking at somebody else.~
@941=~Stop worrying about your body. If I wanted a muscle-bound lunkhead, I would have one. Don't you realize you move like a cat? Don't you realize that precise, accurate movements have a very... special appeal for a lady? It's much better than just being smothered.~
@942=~(Kelsey's face is rather flushed)~
@943=~I... ahhh... heh...~
@944=~Hell, I even like the way you walk, man! Do you know that when I put you in the lead it is usually so I can stare at your behind? It's true! I want to bite it right now, that's how much I like it!~
@945=~<CHARNAME>, really... you don't have to say all these things.~
@946=~Why? Who will tell you otherwise? If someone else does, she's dead meat! You're MINE, Kelsey. Your adorable nest of rusty hair and your dreamy scent and all the sweet things you say to me every damn day whether I've been a crabby bitch or not. They're all MINE.~
@947=~...okay, <CHARNAME>... I am past embarrassment. This is officially an ego trip, now.~
@948=~Every time we kiss, I feel like I might explode. That's the sorcerer in you, that's the MAN in you that does it to me. I love you. I love to trace your set jaw with my fingers, I love to feel your cool skin against mine. I love you because You. Are. The. Perfect. Man. Is that so hard to understand?~
@949=~I am just soaking all this in now...~
@950=~Then listen good. Your lovemaking is fantastic. I don't care anymore that I was not your first--you obviously learned enough to get good at it. You are my favorite blanket and my favorite mattress. Your body is my favorite food. Sex with you is my favorite hobby. I have gone Kelsey and I will not go back.~
@951=~(Kelsey's shifting from one foot to another has increased as you reached the home stretch.)~
@952=~Whew... there was so much, I don't even know what I can say back to you. "I love you too" is the best start... oh, and I should tell you that what you just said is the most arousing thing I've ever heard. Mmmmph.~ [FWKL2566]
@953=~We need to go have a "private talk" about something... anything... soon. Please. Mmmm.~ [FWKL2567]
@954=~(on cue, Kelsey's mouth breaks into a smile, front teeth shining out at you as he reddens slightly)~
@955=~Well, you make me smile, <CHARNAME>.~
@956=~I try. Actually, I don't know if that's true, not as much as I should... I know that I am a serious person much of the time, but... business is serious, life is serious, death and danger are serious and it gets to be a habit.~
@957=~You goon, stop apologizing! I was not criticizing you, I was telling you I love your smile!~
@958=~It's a wonderful smile, on a wonderful face. (kiss Kelsey)~
@959=~Okay. No apologies. I'll just stand here and grin at you for a while and we'll be even. Don't forget to tell me when to quit.~
@960=~(Kelsey smiles even wider, then he seems to think better of it, and pulls you closer, his expression just serious enough to merge his lips with yours...)~
@961=~Thank y--mmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMM...~
@962=~You have been so much more to me... whatever I have done for you is because you deserve even more.~
@963=~I certainly served other company commanders, other women before you... I meet thousands and thousands of new people every year on the road... but nobody has touched my life as you have.~
@964=~So if I am anything less than a benefit to have at your side, then I am not a good friend.~
@965=~But you are, Kelsey! You ARE a good friend to me! I feel like you understand me, or at least try to.~
@966=~Careful giving me too much credit, <CHARNAME>... you are not a simple woman and I do not mean because of your heritage. But I like... I love you... for everything that I still need to learn.~
@967=~I suppose it would be ridiculous to say that I am "scared", but... well, you and I have spent our whole lives not being married, right?~
@968=~I know that you never really knew a husband and wife as you grew up, but I did, and I think I learned enough by example to know what to do and not to do.~
@969=~Seriously... I want to put an end to the fighting, pull off these marching boots we've been wearing forever, burn them, and then get married.~
@970=~It will be that simple. We will make it be that simple.~
@971=~I hope so, my love.~
@972=~...tell me again, why are we even waiting?~
@973=~By the way... especially considering that you are the most famous woman on the planet, I do not expect you to take my last name. I am happy to share, but it is entirely up to you.~
@974=~Heh. I have this bizarre image in my mind of Cespenar both presiding and being the ring-bearer, flapping his wings back and forth to do both jobs...~
@975=~I know that we know priests, but... we are far from home, and we still have a job--your job--to do. We waited some time to discuss the idea of getting married, and I am comfortable waiting a little longer to truly do it right.~
@976=~Then it's a perfect match... both of us seeing exactly what we should see in the other.~
@977=~No, listen. You set aside your life to fight my battles, and never asked for anything in return. You fought for so much...~
@978=~Of course I did. You needed my help... and you should know by now that I care about you and want to keep you safe, no matter what it takes.~
@979=~My sorcerous love... the Slayer could have killed you, Bodhi enslaved you, you died with me and came back through Hell...  and you are still by my side! I can never repay you for filling the empty place in my heart so perfectly. If I should fall in battle tomorrow or the next day, that will never change.~
@980=~(Kelsey holds your right hand in his as you say this, stroking your wrist with his left)~
@981=~I could never have done all those things if you were not a wonderful person, to begin with, <CHARNAME>.~ [FWKL2568]
@982=~(hug Kelsey tightly) I love you, Kelsey.~
@983=~(Kelsey returns your strong embrace, clenching his fingers slowly and gently against your shoulder blades. He sighs contendedly in your ear) I love you too, <CHARNAME>.~

@984=~I have tried to be brave for you, because it is the right thing to do, and because I want to support you, not make you doubt yourself.~ [FWKL2569]
@985=~But this is it. This is where Melissan tries to take you away from me.~ [FWKL2570]
@986=~I really try not to be a vengeful man... it's scary and it's dangerous... but that twisted bitch is going to die so that we can live, and put an end to this suffering and conspiring and betrayal.~ [FWKL2571]
@987=~And when we stop her, then the gods and the prophecy and the Bhaal essence... well, we don't know.~ [FWKL2572]
@988=~It's important to me that we see things through... you taught me the value of being truly thorough, of really believing in a person and a cause. That is why the best "deal" I have ever made was proposing to marry you.~ [FWKL2573]
@989=~There is the very, very important matter of our baby that we need to see through.~ [FWKL2574]
@990=~What I am trying to say is that I want the rest of our lives together to be much more than the next five minutes.~ [FWKL2575]
@991=~You are so sweet, promising to tear Melissan limb from limb for me!~
@992=~You are right, my love... we will win, and if we are meant to be together, then we will be.~
@993=~Kelsey, this is all bigger than you and I, but I will not let any power in the universe tear us apart.~
@994=~Relax. Focus. I need you to be focused now more than ever.~
@995=~I am very serious, <CHARNAME>.~
@996=~We will, yes. Of all the pitiful schemers in the world, she is lower than the heavy-thumbed butcher. And I wouldn't let a heavy-thumbed butcher come between us.~
@997=~It is a lot of power, that she is trying to wield. But then, you and I have learned more than a little about our own potential.~
@998=~Oh, don't get me wrong, <CHARNAME>. I cannot turn off my feelings for you when we fight, but I am, without a doubt, ready, willing, and eager to snuff out that charlatan. It is the right thing to do, for me, for you... for everyone.~
@999=~But I don't want to talk about her anymore. She will be over and done with soon. I want to tell you... and I hope not for the last time... about you.~
@1000=~Nobody can make me feel special and wanted the way that you can. Nobody has ever tried to bring me love... not just physicality, not just a dependence, but a real sense of teamwork and belonging and closeness.~
@1001=~And nobody else can do it again. You are my favorite heroine. Whatever else your destiny has done, for whatever pain it has caused you... I am truly sorry for those things, but it has brought you into my life, and made me a better man for it.~
@1002=~I think you already know these things. I try to make you feel all the love I have for you. It's all I can do, now... try to convince you, and hope.~
@1003=~If you didn't worry just a little too much, you wouldn't be my Kelsey. Everything will be fine!~
@1004=~I love you, Kelsey. Whatever happens, that will always be true.~
@1005=~I know all these things, Kelsey. Come... we should be done with this so that life can begin anew.~
@1006=~Yes. Let's go, before I start talking again.~
@1007=~I will always love you, too... I just want to hold your hand, and not your memories, as I tell you so.~

@1008=~It's truly amazing what you and I can do together now... we have amassed so much power, I can hardly believe it. When I think of what I could do, just at your request... it's frightening, but the independence, the control...~ [FWKL2576]
@1009=~It's a little exciting, too. And that is also frightening. I don't know.~
@1010=~Oh no, we're not doing this bit where you get upset no matter what I say and accuse me of just wanting you to blow things up again.~
@1011=~Yes, but we use all this power to do good things. What's so troubling about that?~
@1012=~You lack imagination if all you can think to do with that power is whine.~
@1013=~What is it you want me to say?~
@1014=~Since it's just me and my Kelsey against the world, I prefer having the odds more in our favor. Don't you?~
@1015=~No, no, it's nothing like that, <CHARNAME>. I'm just... thinking aloud, is all.~
@1016=~You are right, of course, <CHARNAME>. And I admire you for that, truly.~
@1017=~I wonder about that. It seems like we could be doing more. I know that you have a goal and a destiny, but we have had other opportunities along the way to do more.~
@1018=~I do not want to start a fight. We're doing what you think is necessary. I love you, and I accept that.~
@1019=~Just hear me out, that's all. I know that your life has been nothing but constant change for some time now, but I am having a little trouble adjusting, I think.~
@1020=~I do, my love, I do.~
@1021=~What is that supposed to mean?~
@1022=~Nothing.~
@1023=~I mean that your mealy-mouthed manner disgusts me. You have no spine and no ambition. You couldn't hang on to power if your hands were coated in sap.~
@1024=~I mean that you worry too much. I won't be judged. We do what we have to do with every drop of strength and determination we can find.~
@1025=~I mean that you need to start thinking for yourself. You have this power. So use it, and be something bigger than you ever could have been before.~
@1026=~That's... lovely, <CHARNAME>. Just lovely.~
@1027=~Never mind. I think I see where this conversation, and any future chat, is going to go anyway.~
@1028=~Yes, yes we do. And I'm not worrying about any judges but ourselves. I want to fight for you more than anything, but I just need to stop and consider things, that's all.~
@1029=~I think I do, I have. That's part of my point.~
@1030=~Things have changed so fast. I remember when the sack at the back of the Copper Coronet looked like a good place to stash extra gear. Now, you have your own little dimension.~
@1031=~I wonder if a year ago, I could even recognize myself now. We have done things together that few people could dream of... we have been places hardly anyone has ever seen.~
@1032=~The way I channel magic now... well, I haven't actually MET many archmages but I think I'm in the neighborhood. When I think back to playing with magic missile, and feeling guilty about it... it's almost like it isn't even me.~
@1033=~I don't think even the storybooks have much in the way of couples who fight as we do. I like it... knowing how we can both look out for each other against almost any odds.~
@1034=~It... well, it kind of turns me on, actually.~
@1035=~(say nothing)~
@1036=~Yes, I've noticed. You're rather hard... to deal with, after a big battle.~
@1037=~That's appalling!~
@1038=~Heh. I might actually apologize for being an inconvenience, but the look on your face makes me think it's not.~
@1039=~I'm sorry if that bothers you. It's not exactly in a sexual way, not the way you might think.~
@1040=~It's just the sense of feeling so invulnerable with you, near you, in your arms... like we can be together and not have to fear.~
@1041=~I know it might have sounded like I was complaining... but as I talk about it, and think about it, I don't know that there's actually anything wrong.~
@1042=~I am actually glad that I had this opportunity to learn more about my magic. It has really put things into perspective, being able to fight for you, to protect you... thank you for making me such a part of your life. It truly has been the chance of a lifetime, in more ways than I could ever thank you for.~
@1043=~Sounds like somebody wants a raise.~
@1044=~You've meant more to my life than words can express, Kelsey. Our powers seem small by comparison to our love.~
@1045=~You are welcome, of course, my love. We make a great team.~
@1046=~Let's not get all weepy, there's work to be done with all this power.~
@1047=~Not at all. I am not with you for money, <CHARNAME>. I am with you for you.~
@1048=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. That's sweeter than I could have put it.~
@1049=~We really do. In just about everything, I like to think.~
@1050=~... all right, as you say, boss. I just thought I'd try to let you know how I feel about you.~

@1051=~Heya, Kelsey. Got a second?~
@1052=~Of course I do, Imoen. You don't even have to ask.~ [FWKL2577]
@1053=~If I don't ask, how can you tell me?~
@1054=~Anyway, um, have you noticed anything different about me lately?~
@1055=~Oh. Uh, I... like what you did to your hair? Is that a new braid...?~
@1056=~You're still such a lousy liar.~
@1057=~Sorry. Okay. Honestly, no, I don't see anything different.~
@1058=~I... I feel different, Kelsey. Things have been happening to me.~
@1059=~You don't mean you're growing up, do you? Wait, kidding, don't hit me...~
@1060=~I'm tryin' to be serious here, you goon.~
@1061=~I can do things I shouldn't be able to. I could heal you now, just by thinking about it. I know I'm a lot stronger and faster than I used to be.~
@1062=~It's neat and all, and I kind of like it, but it's scary. Because I know why it's happening.~
@1063=~Ohhhh. Imoen, it's okay. It doesn't have to be a bad thing. Just remember... you're not alone.~
@1064=~I know I'm not the only Bhaalspawn around here. But <CHARNAME> is used to this stuff by now.~
@1065=~It's not just <PRO_HIMHER>. I'm not the same as you, but I know what it's like, to just suddenly find this place inside that wasn't there before, that tells me how to do something new.~
@1066=~It doesn't have to be a bad thing, Imoen. It used to scare me all the time... every time I learned something new, or even every time I used it. But you can make it work for you, and do good things, even... even considering the source.~
@1067=~I... I think I liked it better when I was just Imoen. Not Imoen T. Bhaalspawn.~
@1068=~But, Imoen, a few extra spells don't make you a different person. Take it from me.~
@1069=~And as for the rest, what Bhaal put inside you... well, that's always been part of who you are. You just found out about it later than most, I guess. But just about everyone likes who you are, if you haven't noticed.~
@1070=~Oh yeah? Well, that's just good taste and good breeding coming together, I guess.~
@1071=~I see you're feeling a little better.~
@1072=~Yeah, I think so. Thanks.~
@1073=~So... um, you're a sweet guy and all, Kelsey, but can I have my hand back? I might need it.~
@1074=~Oh. Sure.~
@1075=~So I guess you really COULD beat me at arm wrestling now, huh?~
@1076=~You better believe it, buddy. I'll show ya sometime.~
@1077=~Heh.~

@1088=~I don't envy you the choices you still have to make. There have only been a handful of people in all of history who have faced these possibilities.~ [FWKL2581]
@1089=~I am concerned at what your choice could mean. The notion of... of somehow picking up where Bhaal left off. Is that truly what you have lived your life for? Is that what we have fought for?~
@1090=~Only a fool would walk away from this sort of birthright.~
@1091=~I don't think it would work that way. I would not necessarily become "the next Bhaal."~
@1092=~I don't know. All I can do is keep doing what it looks like I should be doing.~
@1093=~No, I don't believe so.~
@1094=~I can see why it would be hard to walk away from this sort of offer. But I think you need to consider the alternatives.~
@1095=~That's all any of us can do, <CHARNAME>. But I don't think you can just go with the flow on this one. You will need to make a decision.~
@1096=~I'm almost surprised to hear you say that. I could see how you might feel that the universe owed you, by now.~
@1097=~Consider this: you may have the chance to evolve, to become more than just a <PRO_MANWOMAN>. And I really can see how that adventure could be too tempting to ignore.~
@1098=~But with your experience, your skills, your insight... consider what kind of a <PRO_MANWOMAN> you could become if you worked at that instead? You have your whole life ahead of you, and have already accomplished so much.~
@1099=~This... evolution might be too much to ignore. But you could become great without the baggage of Bhaal. Think about it.~

@1100=~Imoen... were you just snooping through my pack?~ [FWKL25D2]
@1101=~Snooping? Don't you know research at work when you see it?~
@1102=~I know snooping at work when I see it.~
@1103=~Hey, I gotta look out for my sister. Find out what sort of fellow she's mixed up with.~
@1104=~I see.~
@1105=~Yeah. I mean, she's great and all, but you know, you ARE a sorcerer, you could just be charming the pants off her and she doesn't even know it. So to speak.~
@1106=~I wouldn't do that to her, Imoen, or anybody. I don't know how much it's your business, but I really do love <CHARNAME>.~
@1107=~I'll be the judge of that.~
@1108=~I didn't find any love letters from other girls, that was a good start. I think I found old fingernail clippings, though, which is just disgusting.~
@1109=~Oh. I get it. This isn't about <CHARNAME> and me, this is ritual abuse.~
@1110=~No, I told you, it's research.~
@1111=~Your journal wasn't bad reading, though. I can't believe you asked her to do that to you. That's just... weird.~
@1112=~All right, that's enough. Imoen. What is your point?~
@1113=~Just that you'd better be good to my sister, because I'm watching you.~
@1114=~Okay. I promise. I wouldn't have done anything to hurt her before this, you know.~
@1115=~Now can I please have my journal back?~
@1116=~Yeah, sure. It's kind of creepy thinking about you two... ugh.~

@1117=~So, Anomen... you are something of the expert on service. Do you have any suggestions for me? For an organization to join, I mean.~ [FWKL25D3]
@1118=~Are you serious?~
@1119=~I don't know, without knowing what my options might be. That is why I am asking you. I thought you might have some suggestions.~
@1120=~Choosing to serve an organization greater than yourself is hardly a matter to be taken lightly, or pursued on a whim.~
@1121=~I realize that. But I do not think I can be satisfied anymore just going between mercenary and caravan service and the trade business. It will seem... very empty, after all this. So I am serious about wanting something else.~
@1122=~<CHARNAME> and I will hopefully be together a long, long time, but neither of us will be idle, I expect. I am just thinking about options.~
@1123=~Hmmph. Well. The Order certainly has its uneasy partnership with wizards at times, when it serves a common purpose of justice, but I doubt you would find a place with the Cowled Wizards to your liking.~
@1124=~Yes, that's true.~
@1125=~You lack the confident bearing one expects in a great leader of men, but you are... not unaccomplished in your fields of endeavor. 'Tis not for true men of action, but perhaps some political office might suit you.~
@1126=~A bit backhanded, but I suppose I will take it.~
@1127=~Did you expect to be sponsored for a post in the Order? There is little point in pretending men are not born and bred to be different from one another.~

@1128=~Here, Aerie, catch!~ [FWKL25D4]
@1129=~Ah!~
@1130=~Oh, what is this?~
@1131=~A nectarine. You said you wanted to try one, so I picked one up for you. They're good.~
@1132=~M-maybe you shouldn't have thrown it at me... my hands are all sticky now!~
@1133=~Well, the juice is sort of the best part, but you're right, that wasn't really the smartest thing to do. Sorry.~
@1134=~Mmmmm... well, it is very good, anyway. Thank you, Kelsey.~
@1135=~Too bad they are so squishy. I don't think they would keep very well, with all the fighting we do.~
@1136=~It's hard to be a gourmet on the road, Aerie. Enjoy it while you can. I suppose I should have picked up a towel for you, too...~

@1137=~Jaheira, have you ever wondered if the universe is having a laugh at our expense? Exposing us to sights, sounds, smells nobody should ever have to deal with, over and over and over?~ [FWKL25D5]
@1138=~I had not thought you the philosophical type.~
@1139=~Call it good influences, then. Or bad, depending on how this goes.~
@1140=~I mean... does it ever seem to you like we could have avoided hurt and pain if only we had said something a little different, or stood a few feet more to the right or left, and the only reason we didn't was so somebody could have a good laugh?~
@1141=~So much lost, with so little to replace it... it is cold comfort to think of that as someone's idea of a joke.~
@1142=~Much in our lives is lost, to the universe's grand joke, if that image suits you. But nature's cycle has a way of... replenishing what is taken from us, at times.~
@1143=~You are wishing that you had been somewhere else when <CHARNAME> crossed your path? Being with <PRO_HIMHER> has forced you to face an evolution in yourself that might have remained hidden. Is that a joke?~
@1144=~No, it's not that. I think I would simply like a word with whomever is in charge, someday, about how we get chosen for certain assignments.~
@1145=~Be careful what you wish for. The way things are going, such a meeting may be on your calendar sooner than you think.~

@1146=~Keldorn... you've served a long time, fighting evil, enforcing the law... and you know good from evil when you see it.~ [FWKL25D6]
@1147=~Yes, all very true.~
@1148=~Then after all you have seen, do you believe there are truly good people in the world who aren't already paladins or near-demigods or the like?~
@1149=~Indeed I do. It is part of what makes my calling rewarding. "Fighting evil" is a cry of the vigilante, it is not enough to build a life of service upon. Fighting FOR good, the good of many... that is something entirely different. And it is not always apparent, even to old paladins, which is which.~
@1150=~But even you can be tricked, betrayed... doesn't that get frustrating?~
@1151=~It is unfortunate. But one of the advantages of experience is that I can accept that not every story has a happy ending, and sometimes the snake is venomous, without losing faith.~
@1152=~Have you found yourself doubting the greater good?~
@1153=~No, not exactly. I don't know how much I ever truly believed in it... perhaps I am gaining confidence in it now, for the first time in a long time.~
@1154=~Ah. Growing pains, then. They shall pass.~

@1200=~Elminster is one in a million. If that. Nothing says you could never succumb. Nothing says he could never succumb.~
@1201=~(sigh) ...as ever, nice talking with you, Mister Corthala.~


@1210=~Oh Kelsey... hold quite still, please.~
@1211=~WHAT is THAT?~ [FWKl25x8]
@1212=~This, my fugitive friend, is your salvation, an insurance policy in a three-foot turnip-powered wand built with my own loving hands. Now close your eyes and hold very still while I shoot you with it... if you look into the beam I'm afraid you might suffer the same fate as Cousin Blidus Jansen, and I'm not sure I can get both of your eyes in as quickly as I did his... the arthritis is acting up today, you see.~
@1213=~Jan... you're scaring me, and I feel like either running away or hitting you. Don't shoot me with anything, especially not if you made it.~
@1214=~You wound me greater than you could know. Greater than sprinkling pickled turnip juice on a papercut across the septum, even though it's a wonderful cure-all and I'd like you to stop by for some before you go running off to the healers after our next big scrape. Now, where was I?~
@1215=~You were not pointing that thing at me until you tell me what it does.~
@1216=~Oh, yes, of course. Well, certainly you remember the tale I told you about Plumpy and the oat-counting, right? It all started when my friend Plumpy--~
@1217=~--talked to his breakfast and told everyone that if they didn't do what he said, his Oatmeal Enforcers would come get them.~
@1218=~"College of Granary Mages Special Patrol", they prefer to be called to their faces, yes. It occurs to me that I doubt I'll be able to shield you from their wrath when they come around and try to turn you into an abacus, so it's time we go to Plan L. And before you ask, I tried plans B, C, D, and E last night but none of them stuck to the wall, F, G, and H were spatial impossibilities on this plane and there's an incredibly large group of intelligent odors holding a week-long conference in the plane we COULD use, Plan I tasted bad and Plans J and K, sadly, would mean the dissolution of most major governments and the permanent suspension of happy hour.~
@1219=~Anyway, this rod is your salvation, Kelsey. One touch, and you'll be able to shield yourself from the highly baleful eye of those shock troopers. They'll walk past you and never see a sorcerer who hasn't done his required service in the silos.~
@1220=~Jan, I'm not worried about the "Granary Mages." I swear. I can handle them if they do exis--that is, if they do show up. I'd really rather you get that thing away from me since... yes, that's smoke rising out of it, Jan...~
@1221=~That's how you know it's working. So few great inventions respect the #4 rule of design, which is that a good gadget must leave no doubt that it's doing something, even if it isn't what it says on the label. Labels are so unreliable, they hardly tell you a thing about the nature of the universe or how to keep your nose warm in an ice salamander's lair at teatime.~
@1222=~... I don't care. Put it... no, THROW it away. It looks really dangerous.~
@1223=~Nonsense. What's dangerous is griffon-baiting without a handful of sunflower seeds and pixie dust--the dust to turn invisible, of course, and the seeds to eat while you're hiding and waiting for the griffon to calm down and finish digesting your friend.~
@1224=~See? I bet you hardly felt a thing.~
@1225=~What? You used it already? But ...nothing happened.~
@1226=~Ah. Well, as sure as it says Genuine Jansen on the label, it says right here that something did happen. You should be able to blend into the scenery as far as those jackbooted cereal-lovers are concerned.~
@1227=~But you're not feeling any different? No itching, burning, extra limbs beginning to bud?~
@1228=~No, I feel fine. I don't think you and your smoky wand DID anything.~
@1229=~Nothing at all? Hmmm. Most test subjects at least report severe gastric distress. Ah well, something for you to look forward to next time.~
@1230=~Next time? Forget it, keep ALL of your toys away from me!~
@1231=~You wouldn't send a gnome away without a trial run, wouldn't you? Why, I labored for minutes building the "Jansen Anti-Granary Mage Illusion Field Ray Mark IV", I think in all fairness you at least owe me the satisfaction of knowing that it was time well spent.~
@1232=~I'm telling you that I don't feel any different.~
@1233=~That's because you don't have cause to hide! There's not a Granary Mage for leagues around, since they always hold their underhand-throw darts tournament this time of year, but we can work around that.~
@1234=~I'll pretend to be one of the Special Patrol, and all you think about is hiding from my oatmeal-soaked hide. The special power should work like a dream!~
@1235=~Ready?~
@1236=~(sigh) Ready.~
@1237=~(ahem) Halt! Kelsey the sorcerer, you are charged with willful evasion of oat-counting duties as described in the Treatise of Plumpleuff, dated--~
@1238=~Oh my. An Oatmeal Enforcer. I'd best try to hide from him...~
@1239=~Er... something IS happening...~

// [start cutscene, Kelsey zaps Jan, Jan turns to oats.]

@1240=~...Jan? Jan, I don't know if you can see me, but now I can't see you. Where are you?~ [FWKl25x9]
@1241=~Oh my. This was quite unexpected.~
@1242=~I can't see you, Kelsey, but I do have an innate mushy sense that you're there. I do believe that the JAGMIFR Mark IV needs a little refinement.~
@1243=~Where are you?~
@1244=~Look downward, but watch your step... I can't see myself but I have an innate mushy sense that I've been turned into something delicious and nutritious...~
@1245=~Oh, by Waukeen's purse... you're a bowl of oatmeal?!?~
@1246=~With a hint of cinnamon, nutmeg, and donkey's milk, yes indeed. I'm an oatmeal-lover's dream.~
@1247=~So... this thing doesn't work, and now I've turned you into a bowl of oatmeal?~
@1248=~It's not so bad. I spent a fortnight as a plate of bacon and eggs to dodge the taxman during the Billiard Ball Crackdown of '38. Very nearly backfired on me when an exhausted collector, half-delirious with hunger, burst in on my hiding place, but fortunately Golodon's latest apprentice had stopped by and polymorphed himself into a plate of pigs-in-a-blanket, and the functionary chose him instead. Poor kid.~
@1249=~All right, Jan... let me see if I can dispel it, or something.~
@1250=~Take your time. You'd be surprised what kind of revelations can be had just wallowing in some hot water, feeling one's starches break up and become digestible--~

// [Cutscene: Kelsey reconstitutes Jan]

@1251=~Back to my old self, as good as new or better. Mmmmm. Wonder if the taste of oats will ever fade from my lips. A good quaff and swish of turnip mead should clear that up.~
@1252=~Looks like it's back to the drawing board... or perhaps just a new label and a different sales pitch. At least I know where to find a sorcerer for more testing.~
@1253=~Jan... I don't know what you've done to me, and I'm very glad that you're back to... normal, but if you come anywhere near me with another one of your inventions, I cannot be held responsible for any and all violent actions I take.~
@1254=~Someday, Kelsey, you'll thank me. Besides, I can think of a lot of situations where a young man might want to be able to turn someone into a bowl of oatmeal. I just so happen to have a pamphlet here on that very subject. Plumpy--Bane rest his soul--and I worked up a rough draft when we were just lads. Poor, poor Plumpy.~

@1300=~But he was a sneaky coot, I bet he's fine. He'd better be fine.~

// Kelsey-TOB 2 content

@1301=~Kelsey, when we are done with our numbers, who do we repay?~
@1302=~Minsc, when you... what?~ [FWKL25E0]
@1303=~These numbers you gave Minsc and Boo, Kelsey. All this borrowing has Boo frowning with great disapproval.~
@1304=~Minsc is an honest ranger who pays his debts! You may ask any man in the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge! There will be no kidnapping of hamsters for debt ransom!~
@1305=~No, Minsc, "borrowing" is just the name for how we move the numbers to help make the arithmetic easier. Borrowing. That's when we take one away from the number on the left and add a one to the number on the right. I showed you how this works last night, remember?~
@1306=~Perhaps the small red freak can teach the gargantuan purple freak new tricks. (Doubtful. Shorn monkeys would pass for intelligent company sooner than these two.)~
@1307=~Yes, the lesson was very good, and here, we have made a very good list of each and every time a number is borrowed. But Boo and I are confused because we do not know what treacherous financial foe opposes us on the other side of the list.~
@1308=~Minsc, I think you are over-thinking this. See, borrowing is like the opposite of carrying. When we take away the one here, and we add the one here, it's really all still the same numbers.~
@1309=~And they are YOUR numbers, you don't have to pay anybody back when you borrow.~
@1310=~Ehhhh, this numbers business is much more confusing than the usual business of butt-kicking. We have tried hard, but we do not have a head for figures like you do.~
@1311=~I am glad you showed us what you do when you are not putting right to wrong behind Minsc and Boo! This ledger is at least as mysterious as Dynaheir's spellbook. This world of numbers is not for us.~
@1312=~But now we will know which of our friends can help us when evil men have stolen the money of sweet nice good people! We shall call our ledger-killing friend Kelsey, who will find the money and is so smart he will do it without borrowing or paying back what he did not borrow!~
@1313=~I wish I could help you more.~
@1314=~Then answer the call to slay the ledgers of evil wherever Minsc and Boo fight oppressive parchment! This is all we can ask of our smart friend.~
@1315=~"The Ledgers Of Evil"? Perhaps 'tis a stirring tale of romance and betrayal, of a twisted man of affairs more interested in the figures of his bill of sale than the figure of his shapely wife, long neglected as the robber-baron plunders the innocent... ah, yes, a new yarn worth spinning!~
@1316=~But, Minsc, wouldn't you... wouldn't BOO feel better knowing that when you get older, or if you weren't able to fight as well, you would know how to do other things and take care of yourself?~
@1317=~I would hate to see you end up in a tavern, cracking skulls for coppers, but I have seen it happen to veterans who lose a step or two and don't know any other skill.~
@1318=~Do not be sad, Kelsey! The forest will always be a home for us, and it teaches everything we need to know!~
@1319=~Minsc gathers the berries and Boo divides them. Boo eats some, and the remainder is for Minsc. So we do our own arithmetic, Kelsey, and we are happy.~

@1320=~I am curious, Kelsey... why here? Why this place, this company?~
@1321=~Your attachment to <CHARNAME> is clear enough, but I must wonder what drew you to this band in the first place.~
@1322=~Your affection for Imoen is clear enough, but I must wonder what drew you to this band in the first place.~
@1323=~Your attachment to Imoen is clear enough, but I must wonder what drew you to this band in the first place.~
@1324=~You have acquitted yourself well, yet of all the unlikely fellows I have served with, you may surprise me most.~
@1325=~What is so surprising?~ [FWKL25E1]
@1326=~That you choose the blood and sweat over the spice roads. You are certainly not the first regular visitor to Trademeet to declare himself "adventurer" and set out with a small band bent on reshaping the world.~
@1327=~Then I still don't see why you would be surprised.~
@1328=~Perhaps it is that you have come so much farther than they. And perhaps that is because you seem to have some inkling of limits and the perils of overconfidence.~
@1329=~Most men of business who set out as you have will hear nothing of danger or their own inexperience. They throw themselves into the part as though willpower shall keep them safe, they--~
@1330=~They buy their own sales pitch.~
@1331=~Yes, exactly!~
@1332=~It's what good salesmen do. It helps them sell something even if they would not take it if their own mother tried to give it to them for free.~
@1333=~Such single-minded determination is the death of many of them.~
@1334=~I would think single-minded determination would be a good quality to a knight.~
@1335=~It is a good quality IN a knight, Kelsey. One trained and disciplined as a knight. Those attributes cannot be claimed by the highest bidder or finessed by coin-shaving.~
@1336=~But if that is not your way, if you never convinced yourself you were invincible in the first place, then again I must ask why you feel this is your place. You have looked uneasy at times, as though you would rather be anywhere else.~
@1337=~I don't know how to explain. I saw this <PRO_MANWOMAN> stand before an onslaught of Cowled Wizards and the fact that <PRO_HESHE> survived showed me... something.~
@1338=~Call it opportunity, and a better opportunity than I had without <PRO_HIMHER>. An opportunity to help <CHARNAME> with whatever challenges <PRO_HESHE> faced. An opportunity to break out of the boring cycle my life had become. An opportunity to be part of a story I did not know the ending to.~
@1339=~Maybe I do not belong to Bhaal's story the way his powerful child does, or even the way a knight of Arvoreen does, but the firestorm in the Athkatlan Promenade told me that I should be part of it.~
@1340=~Very well, Kelsey. It is a more detailed explanation than I had expected. Although I have not forgotten the true reason you travel so far and wide with us.~
@1341=~The true reas--? Oh, you mean what I said about the shoes.~
@1342=~Yes, Kelsey. So long as Arvoreen grants me breath, I shall never forget the adventuring salesman and footwear "enthusiast."~

@1343=~You know, Cernd, I think I am just now becoming truly comfortable with all of the magical powers I can harness.~ [FWKL25E2]
@1344=~Of course, this probably doesn't come as a big surprise to you. It was only "natural" that I would come to appreciate it in time, right?~
@1345=~Man is one of nature's few creatures given both the gift of self-awareness and the burden of self-doubt. But I always had confidence that you would come to see more of the gift and less of the burden, in time.~
@1346=~Oh? Thank you.~
@1347=~Indeed, you are possessed of many unique talents. For instance, I have rarely met another with such a keenly honed jackal call.~
@1348=~I don't know any animal calls, Cernd.~
@1349=~I am afraid I know a young female jackal who would disagree. Your unusual nocturnal noises had an irresistible effect on her.~
@1350=~I was surrounded by jackals in my sleep? And you didn't do anything about it?~
@1351=~I would never dream of interfering in nature's design, Kelsey. I assure you that you were in no danger. I have never seen a jackal's gentle affections result in death or injury, although I do suspect that slight rash on your cheek may be an allergic reaction.~
@1352=~Gah! Are you saying this jackal was licking me?~
@1353=~Why, yes.~
@1354=~Nothing inappropriate ensued that might compromise your relationship with <CHARNAME>, I assure you.~
@1355=~Nothing inappropriate ensued that might compromise your relationship with Imoen, I assure you.~
@1356=~Ew. Go... wash your face, or something.~
@1357=~Nothing inappropriate ensued, I assure you.~
@1358=~I believe that while she was disappointed by your lack of fur, she considers you a perfect gentleman.~
@1359=~Cernd, can you please wake me up before I make any more special friends?~
@1360=~I cannot stand in the way of nature's most primal forces, Kelsey, but I may be able to give proper warning.~
@1361=~See, Kelsey? I have always said you are one irresistible man.~
@1362=~Hmph. And you told me I was all the woman you would ever need.~
@1363=~I knew that snoring of yours would get us in trouble someday.~
@1364=~How cute. See, Kelsey? There's somebody out there for everybody.~
@1365=~I thought the sorcery was bizarre, but this is ridiculous.~
@1366=~Uh oh. Cernd, nothing like that has ever happened to me, has it?~
@1367=~Hey, Kelsey... does she have a sister?~
@1368=~You know, Gorion warned me about men like you, Kelsey. The kind women just couldn't keep their PAWS off of... (snicker)~
@1369=~No, but if you too worry about being preyed upon by nature's randier citizens, I shall tell you if I notice you doing any mating dances.~
@1370=~This was NOT what I had in mind...~
@1371=~I did! I do! This is ridiculous.~
@1372=~Sorry, my love. Maybe you had better wake me up next time you hear it... before something else does.~
@1373=~Very funny.~
@1374=~I didn't do it on purpose!~

@1375=~Imoen? It didn't sound like you were sleeping very well last night.~ [FWKL25E3]
@1376=~Ugh. Kelsey, when a girl wakes up feeling this bad, it wasn't sleep.~
@1377=~Do you want to talk to me about it?~
@1378=~Um, no, I think I would rather talk to me about it.~
@1379=~How did you sleep last night, Imoen?~
@1380=~Terribly, thanks for asking.~
@1381=~Oh, that's too bad, what happened?~
@1382=~I had the worst nightmares of my life.~
@1383=~Really?~
@1384=~No, not really, the ones I had the night before were worse.~
@1385=~Interesting. Do you think this has anything to do with your feelings about your mother?~
@1386=~I don't know who my mother was.~
@1387=~Ahah!~
@1388=~...so, ya see, Kelsey, I'm just about talked out now about the whole nightmare thing, thanks.~
@1389=~Come on, Imoen. If this keeps happening to you, you might feel better talking to someone else. You know, someone who isn't named "Imoen."~
@1390=~It... it's so stupid, I shouldn't be thinking about this anymore. He's dead, they're all dead, or they're not but it doesn't matter.~
@1391=~Go on, I'm listening.~
@1392=~I was in the catacombs at Candlekeep again. And Khalid came up to me and handed me his... his arm. And I tried to make him take it back but he said he wouldn't need it anymore, not where he was going. It was all cut apart and stitched back together, the way Irenicus did while... while I was there.~
@1393=~Oh, Imoen...~
@1394=~And then when I looked up from the arm Khalid was gone and it was Gorion instead and he was very angry and told me that I must run to Tethyr and return Khalid's arm to him because he needed it to hold up his shield. I tried to tell Gorion that Khalid was dead, and couldn't use his arm anymore, and besides he gave it to me but he just kept scowling at me and called me a worthless good-for-nothing little thief.~
@1395=~And then Gorion was gone and it was Bodhi and she took... she took Khalid's arm from me and then she tore MY arm off like it was nothing and she was swinging them around and beating me with them and she kept yelling "Your life is mine! Your life is mine!"~
@1396=~And that's what happens when I go to sleep sometimes. I bet you're glad you asked.~
@1397=~Imoen, I don't even know where to start... Bodhi is destroyed. She's never going to be able to come back to hurt you, not ever.~
@1398=~And I never knew Gorion, but I would stake anything that he would be very proud of you. As for Khalid... I just don't know, Imoen. I'm sorry you had to go through that, and I wish that knowing Irenicus and Bodhi are gone could change things for you, and for everyone else they hurt.~
@1399=~It doesn't, Kelsey. Although it makes it a little better when you get all serious and say so.~
@1400=~C'mon. We can't sit here all day talking about my dreams. <CHARNAME> is rattling <PRO_HISHER> sabre again, I can just tell. So step lively, mister, or <PRO_HESHE> is gonna blame me.~
@1401=~All right, Imoen. But if you ever need to talk, if these dreams wake you up, don't be afraid to let me know.~
@1402=~Of course not. Nobody's afraid of you, Kelsey. That's why we like you.~

@1403=~Hey, Kelsey. I forgot to tell you the worst part of that terrible nightmare I had.~
@1404=~Oh? Please, tell me, Imoen.~ [FWKL25E4]
@1405=~While Bodhi was whacking me with the arms and screaming, suddenly she stopped, and everything else stopped and got very quiet and cold. It was as though the world had turned to ice, and we were the only two living things left.~
@1406=~And she leaned in to me, and I could see and smell the bloodstains on her mouth, and her breath came out icy cold and she said--she said--~
@1407=~Go on...~
@1408=~She said... "TELL KELSEY HE HAS A NICE REAR, BUT A SISSY VOICE."~
@1409=~...Imoen.~
@1410=~Yeah?~
@1411=~You made that entire dream up, didn't you? You were just teasing me the whole time!~
@1412=~No, all the rest of it was really in there. I just wanted to make sure you knew for sure the minute I was feeling better.~

@1413=~When we met, I knew enough about my magic to take care of myself, help you, help others. And I had heard tales of much more powerful mages, of course.~ [FWKL25E6]
@1414=~But I never dreamed I would have reason to use so many of my magical abilities, or develop them to be this... incredible. I think back to when I was afraid of casting fire and it seems comical, like it is the least of my worries and certainly the least of my options.~
@1415=~If anything, you are even more powerful. How do you handle all the power, and all the choices?~
@1416=~Choice is a good thing, Kelsey. For instance, I may choose to cast Silence on you if you cannot take care of it yourself.~
@1417=~I welcome it because I need it. In life we either grow or die.~
@1418=~You want to know a secret, Kelsey? I think you handle it better than I do.~
@1419=~I used to be afraid, like you are, but I have grown to enjoy the power. Magic is second nature now.~
@1420=~I used to be afraid, like you were, but like you I have grown into my abilities. Magic is second nature now.~
@1421=~I enjoy testing my limits. There is always a new challenge, a new spell, or a better way to cast it.~
@1422=~Like I am? No, <CHARNAME>, that is not true any longer. I have the control, and I know what is right and what isn't. Perhaps I need to do more to display that to others, however. I shall work on that.~
@1423=~I understand completely, <CHARNAME>.~
@1424=~Spoken like a true crafts <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I admit that I don't quite think of magic that way. Maybe that is because I was born with this talent, but raised into a non-magical profession, so I don't see magic as a tool I must refine in order to be the best. I just see it as a part of me that grows, like hair.~
@1425=~If you don't want to talk, <CHARNAME>, you don't have to threaten me. Please don't do that in the future.~
@1426=~I really don't appreciate being threatened, <CHARNAME>. But if my company is too bothersome, I will find other things to tend to. Just say the word... boss.~
@1427=~I see your point, but there are not many who have grown as we have... and certainly not this quickly.~
@1428=~Really? You have concerns about your magic? It has never shown, <CHARNAME>.~
@1429=~Even so, I think you have a lot to be proud of. You have developed an obvious gift very well under adverse circumstances, and--while once I would have said I would not likely thank anyone for this--you have helped me develop my magic into something much greater than almost anyone could imagine.~
@1430=~Magic serves me. Or I serve magic. Sometimes I can't tell. Let us speak no further of this.~
@1431=~And the best of continued luck to both of us in staying wary, but not afraid, of our talents.~
@1432=~It has been a great help having someone else to watch and learn from.~
@1433=~You and your magic are doing me a service, nothing more. That you are better now is a good thing, or I would have hired someone else.~
@1434=~I understand, <CHARNAME>. My apologies for the usual bad timing.~
@1435=~I will gladly agree to that, <CHARNAME>.~
@1436=~I never thought of myself as a "model magician" but it pleases me, knowing that I have been able to help. I never thought I would be anything but the uncertain clandestine sorcerer. I am glad we met.~
@1437=~Always ready to put me back in my place, eh, <CHARNAME>?~
@1438=~It says so much that you can continue to surprise me, my love. You are the most accomplished woman I know, and have never failed to do what she had to do, and more. But believe me, I understand how the magical arts can be more of a strain than a service at times.~
@1439=~Still, it has been a rare privilege to watch you grow stronger, to learn from you as I learn more about my own magic. Even with the challenges.~
@1440=~Of course, my dear. I am sorry if I upset you.~
@1441=~And I can think of no better partner to learn from, <CHARNAME>. You have been a blessing and a rock of support for me as I grew into my magic, and to do it while grappling yourself... I don't know what to say. Thank you.~
@1442=~Please don't play with my confidence like that, <CHARNAME>. It makes it hard to concentrate on your behalf.~
@1443=~For me it wasn't one particular day or one particular spell when I realized that I felt differently about it, although it was quite recent. I simply noticed that I was part of the magic and the magic was part of me, and any fight or struggle was something I was creating. It wasn't really part of the spell.~
@1444=~I have a hard time believing how much you and I have learned since we met. Add up the two of us we would still be a fraction of the age of the great seers and arch-mages, and yet I imagine if it came to it we would have the advantage over many of them.~
@1445=~The situations have been dangerous and frightening but I truly believe I am better for having gone through them with you, learning that I could become more comfortable with magic even as it became more and more a part of my daily life, and the spells became stronger and stronger.~
@1446=~That is a lesson I may never have learned on my own path, so I appreciate the time you have spent with me and the chance to do what must be done.~
@1447=~I could never have grown like this or learned so much about myself without your help. Thank you for making me such a part of your life.~

@1448=~Imoen, I don't think you want to come near me with that again.~ [FWKL25I7]
@1449=~With what?~
@1450=~That... that finger!~
@1451=~What, this finger?~
@1452=~Yes, the one you keep zapping me with!~
@1453=~Why not?~
@1454=~Because I may start using MY finger, that's why not.~
@1455=~Hey! See, I SAID you started it! That's proof!~
@1456=~Started it? I showed you a trick, I didn't expect you to use it on me a dozen times!~
@1457=~A dozen?~
@1458=~Ow!~
@1459=~Okay, NOW it's a dozen.~
@1460=~Hey, Imoen?~
@1461=~Yeah, Kelsey?~
@1462=~I really like you a lot, even when you are mercilessly torching me, but... I think you should probably run now.~
@1463=~Hee!~

@1464=~I want you to know that I have never really meant to hurt you, <CHARNAME>. I know there have been a few times when I have not exactly been a knight in shining armor for you, and... I'm sorry.~ [FWKL25J7]
@1465=~All has been forgiven, Kelsey. That's what love is all about.~
@1466=~We both know how to hurt each other. That's the dark side of being close to another person.~
@1467=~Hurt me? What are you talking about?~
@1468=~There are times when "sorry" isn't enough, Kelsey.~
@1469=~I should be the one to apologize to you again, Kelsey.~
@1470=~Even... even after Anomen, that does not give me license to hurt you.~
@1471=~You're right, it is. But I hate to try your patience and test your limits, <CHARNAME>.~
@1472=~I... I know. Damn, <CHARNAME>, I don't do it on purpose. I need you to believe that, that I don't analyze your weaknesses and try to find ways to hurt you, like I am trying to gain an advantage over you!~
@1473=~I hadn't thought of it that way. Now I'm paranoid. Just how are you hoping to use your leverage to hurt me?~
@1474=~You certainly can be very effective when you want to be.~
@1475=~Of course you don't, my love.~
@1476=~I am not, I promise you. But I know that I have been less than perfect for you.~
@1477=~Then all I can do is tell you one more time that I wish I were a better man for you, and then find some way to become him. Before you--~
@1478=~--before it is too late.~
@1479=~There have been times when I have said things that I did not really mean, or wish I had not said, and times when I have not been strong enough to protect you and fight for you the way I wish I could have.~
@1480=~What do you want me to say? That you are perfect? Don't ask me to lie to you, Kelsey. I will give you the truth regardless.~
@1481=~Kelsey, no matter what you think, you have never truly failed me. You couldn't.~
@1482=~I hold my disappointment in you in check because you serve me well, Kelsey. Lose sight of that, and it's over.~
@1483=~Wish, wish, wish. I wish you would apologize less and kiss more.~
@1484=~Don't try so hard. Be you. You are who I love. I can take care of myself, after all.~
@1485=~You make it so easy, <CHARNAME>. You are better than I deserve--no, please don't interrupt, I'm not going to apologize for you being better than I deserve.~
@1486=~I will just bask in my good fortune for a while. I AM the luckiest man on Faerun.~
@1487=~I see. Now.~
@1488=~For the last time... I AM sorry.~
@1489=~(It takes Kelsey a moment to shake the cobwebs of self-doubt from his mind to make sense of your request, but once done he wastes no time embracing you, sliding his hands up your back, caressing your neck gently with his left hand while inhaling deeply with both passion and relief.)~
@1490=~You were right, <CHARNAME>. That was a better idea than whatever I was talking about.~
@1491=~And... the truth is...?~
@1492=~The truth is that you're a flawed man and I'm a flawed woman. Perfect people only love themselves. The rest of us need someone else to make them complete, and I choose you.~
@1493=~The truth is that I live a dangerous life, Kelsey, and while I am happy to have you in mine, I need fewer of your self-absorbed distractions and more support.~
@1494=~The truth is that you would be more than perfect, except for constantly doubting how perfect you are.~
@1495=~The truth is that without misunderstandings and disagreements and weaknesses, life has no flavor. We would all be as dull as mundane part-time traders without them.~
@1496=~The truth is... that I forgot what I was going to say. Kiss me before I remember.~
@1497=~I have never thought of it that way, <CHARNAME>. That is a beautiful thought. I will remember that always, both for our own sakes and for anyone else who ever has cause to doubt why they love another.~
@1498=~You are right, my love. I try not to forget that there will be a better day for these thoughts.~
@1499=~Ahah! And we all know what becomes of THAT sort. If that is how you look at it, then I will look at my drawbacks as assets.~
@1500=~Which, if you do not mind my saying so, improves my balance sheet tremendously!~

@1501=~I hate this feeling that people are afraid of us, <CHARNAME>.~ [FWKL25J8]
@1502=~I know how the situation looks to them, but they don't know you the way I do.~ [FWKL25J9]
@1503=~I know what they think but I don't know HOW they can think it! And they don't even give you a chance!~ [FWKL25K0]
@1504=~You are not just my favorite heroine, you are the heroine of Baldur's Gate! You saved the Tree of Life! And they send warnings and soldiers instead of help.~ [FWKL25K1]
@1505=~Let them fear me. I shall prey upon the cowards and grow all the stronger.~
@1506=~I could not agree more! The least they could do is stay out of my way while I clean up this mess!~
@1507=~Try not to let it bother you, Kelsey. Understanding is harder to win than combat.~
@1508=~Bhaalspawn or prince, anyone who raises a hand to harm you--or me--won't live to regret it.~
@1509=~If they live to regret their mistake, they will have us to thank for it. That irony is enough payback for me.~
@1510=~I know, <CHARNAME>. I would never doubt that. There can be other ways... but I know that that is your way.~
@1511=~True, my love. But there is a certain emptiness in knowing that you are right and everyone else is wrong. That and five copper will get you a pint of mead, the saying goes.~
@1512=~But we can have better than that.~
@1513=~You are right, love. There really is no reason for anyone else to get involved. If only they would trust you to put a stop to the purges, I know things would be different.~
@1514=~It does bother me! Because it is the sort of thing that only feeds itself, I am sure of it.~
@1515=~I am old enough to know that there will never be a day when everyone trusts and is trustworthy, but I do know there will come a day when you are recognized for everything you have done without judgment or suspicion.~
@1516=~And I am going to be there. And if you don't mind too much, I will tell everyone that I love you, and loved you all along even while they hid and schemed and feared.~
@1517=~Maybe you shouldn't. I prefer when you say the words to me, and only me.~
@1518=~You can tell them now.~
@1519=~I would like that, Kelsey, but it feels a million miles and a thousand gallons of blood away.~
@1520=~I know what you mean... and yet these months with you have been such a whirlwind that time, and the right moments, always seem to come due before I expect them.~
@1521=~All right, <CHARNAME>. If you don't mind...~
@1522=~I love this woman! She means everything to me! And anything you don't like about her, well, you are dead wrong!~
@1523=~Gah! Chimpanzees in heat.~
@1524=~Wrong? Uh uh! Everything I don't like about <CHARNAME> was painstakingly researched over years and years and... yeesh, I'm just kidding, little sister.~
@1525=~Perhaps you should try that again. You alerted everyone else to our presence, but I think you failed to rouse Gromnir from his grave.~
@1526=~All right, <CHARNAME>.~
@1527=~(Kelsey leans in close--hand resting on your hip, lips brushing at your ear, his breath warm and urgent.) I love you, <CHARNAME>, and always will.~
@1528=~<CHARNAME>, when you say those things... is Bhaal affecting you more now? Is that <CHARNAME>, or the Slayer talking?~
@1529=~(teasing) The Slayer. Run, boy, before she rends you limb from limb!~
@1530=~(serious) The Slayer. Run, boy, before she rends you limb from limb!~
@1531=~It is me. Since when have I shown any mercy for my enemies?~
@1532=~You are right, Kelsey... I don't know what came over me. Sometimes I feel this urge to kill that I cannot control...~
@1533=~I appreciate the joke, <CHARNAME>, but you worry me when you say things like that. If you ever need to be reminded that there is more to life than grappling with Bhaal's legacy... just come hold my hand.~
@1534=~I think I will stand away for a moment while you calm down.~
@1535=~Just because someone is afraid of you, or of us, does not mean they have to be our enemy, <CHARNAME>. I know it doesn't seem like it, but there is real value in talking to people who don't understand you.~
@1536=~Sooner or later, we will have our day and our audience. People will understand. Well, some of them. But that will be better than today.~
@1537=~Oh, my <CHARNAME>... I wish there was some way I could take it away. I can't even give you what little comfort the Solar has. All I can do is hope that what I say makes sense.~
@1538=~I know that you hear Bhaal in a different way than you hear my words, but he doesn't control you. I know that you are stronger than that. And I know we are not what people fear.~
@1539=~I'm sure of it, and I am sure of you.~

@1540=~But, Kelsey, what of our shop and your tower? The vision you told me of our future together was so beautiful. I want nothing more and nothing less.~
@1541=~I didn't realize it meant so much to you... but, this changes nothing!~
@1542=~We will have plenty of land for as much or as little of a trading post as you want, and I will have plenty of room for that tower! Yes! It will work, <CHARNAME>, I am sure of it!~

@1543=~I see that you decided if you could not have me, you would try my sister. Very classy.~
@1544=~It's not that way at all! I really care for Imoen. This has nothing to do with you, <CHARNAME>. I just wanted you to know that I think she's special, and I am glad you had a hand in bringing us together.~

@1545=~That one, on the end of your hand!~
