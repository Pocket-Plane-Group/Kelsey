/* Attention Reader: This is the banter/lovetalk file for Kelsey-SOA.
It is also a TERRIBLE example of WeiDU coding. There are a lot of
reasons for this, most of which are not precisely our fault, but many of
which are. Although you may find some interesting nuggets in here, trust
us, if you plan to write .d code, you won't want a lot of it to look like this.
Far, far better examples of WeiDU coding can be found by combing through
projects such as Kelsey-TOB and Westley Weimer's Valen.

Enjoy the show, but remember, don't code like this at home. */
