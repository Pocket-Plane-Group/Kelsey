# Kelsey
An NPC mod for Baldur's Gate II (BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET)!

Kelsey is an NPC add-on for Baldur’s Gate 2. As a modestly noteworthy trader, Kelsey has traveled far and seen much, but has not found a real sense of purpose to guide his inner talent - sorcery. Fortunately, you have a destiny that needs fulfilling. Kelsey followed the PC through all of Shadows of Amn, and will stand by to take on the challenges of Throne of Bhaal as well. And if your PC is a very special lady, she and Kelsey can find comfort in each other as they take on the challenges of the Five.
